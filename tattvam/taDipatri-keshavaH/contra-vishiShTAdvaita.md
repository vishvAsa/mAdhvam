viśiṣṭādvaita viśleṣaṇa 

viślesana vivecanam 

Introduction: 

have great 

At the very outset, I would like to point out that admiration for Sri Rāmānuja that when the ever confusing points of Advaita were ruling, he made tremendous progress in pointing out the many flaws in there, by founding Visiṣṭādvaita. However due to the will of the Lord some of the newer concepts introduced themselves are not aligned with shashtras. 

Sri Madhvācārya, in aligning his philosophy with the shashtras, pointed out the many shortcomings of previous philosophies and reintroduced earlier known concepts and solidified Tattvavada and set it on a firm foundation. later built upon by the luminaries of his tradition. More importantly, he also foresaw the advent of people with future philosophies such as that of the Gaudiya sampradaya for example and preempted them by giving their statements as Pūrvapakṣa (Objections) and refuting them with statements of Siddhanta (Resolution) well in advance. 

Even an insignificant being like me can see and point out some of the deficiencies in other philosophies, but that is based on the wonderful works of Sri Madhvācārya and his glorious parampara. So, an effective rebuttal of Sri Parakala yati was accomplished by Acharya Madhva and the Guru parampara and I am only pointing out those points. 

Perhaps most ironical to see is that based on the purvapaksha statements on the following write up, Viśiṣṭādvaita does not believe in viśeṣa, while having that in the name itself! Visiṣṭa advaita or qualified Monism is perhaps true to its name. Viśeşa is bheda vyavahāra when abheda is there that is speaking of difference when there is no difference. Visiṣṭādvaita opposes Advaita, but what Advaita accomplishes by vyāvahārikatva and Upādhi and Māyāvāda, all that is accomplished by one entity called 

“dharma-bhūta-jñāna” ( s ) .

1. Advaita says that the jīva and Brahman are same or non- different in the sense that they are identified as 

Visiṣṭādvaita says that the jiva and Brahman are same or non- different in the sense that they are equal. 

2. Advaita says that they appear to be different because of vyāvahārika satya of jagat that is before liberation. 

— 

Visiṣṭādvaita says that they appear to be unequal because of DBJ not expanding to infinity that is before liberation. 

3. Advaita says that when vyāvahārikatva melts away and when ajñāna goes away and when jñāna dawns, the jiva is identified as one same as Brahman. This happens in mokşa or paramartha. 

Visiṣṭādvaita says that when dharma bhuta jnana expands to infinity, the jiva becomes equal to Brahman. This happens in mokṣa. 

4. Advaita says that the jiva needs the grace of the Lord in vyāvahārikatva, but in mokṣa, the jiva is the God. 

Visiṣṭādvaita says that the jiva needs the grace of the Lord for making its dharma bhuta jnana expand infinitely in mokṣa, where the jiva has six qualities like jñāna and Ananda equal to God. 

The purpose of this write-up is to call a spade a spade and respond to the purvapaxins point by point. 

Purvapaksa: 

However, the dvaitins in later times were not so friendly towards Visiṣṭādvaita. Beginning from Jaya Tirtha, dvaita launched a number of attacks on Visiṣṭādvaita, attempting to refute our tradition. 

Siddhanta: 

This person writes elsewhere in glorifying Visiṣṭādvaita 

Quote: 

— 

Swami Rāmānuja showed how the teachings of other darśanas were invalid, and that Visiṣṭādvaita was the true import of the Veda. In this respect, our Swami had numerous advantages over the founders of other darśanams, such as Advaita. 

Unquote: 

Based on the former statement, does the latter statement mean that Visiṣṭādvaitins are not friendly towards the followers of other darśanas? Does this also mean that beginning from Swami Rāmānuja himself, Visiṣṭādvaita launched a number of attacks on other darśanas, attempting to refute their tradition? 

Isn't the root cause of all this a mix-up between a person and a thought, a darśana and a dārśanika, a philosophy and a philosopher, a tradition and a follower of that tradition, a school and a follower/founder of that school? 

If I disagree with a thought of a particular person, it is not tantamount to attacking that person. If one dārśanika sets out to disprove a point of a particular darśana, it is not tantamount to attacking the founder/follower of that darśana. Disagreement with 

some points of another philosophy is not a personal attack of the founder/follower of that philosophy. Refuting some points of a school should not be construed as an attack on the followers of that school. 

The establishment of a theory is not complete without answering the objections of the others. It has to be done at the philosophy level and not at the personal level. It is therefore incorrect to this as attacks. 

In fact there is a class of people, who want to respect every school and every class with a view that "all are correct in their own way; why indulge in any arguments; that will only lead to hatred and disharmony; the universal brotherhood can be achieved by accepting all the schools." 

There are others who think that the elasticity of Sanskrit language is the root cause for multiple schools, all of which are based on Vedic sources and brahmamīmāMsa/brahmasutras. So, how can any one philosophy claim that it alone is accurate in every respect? Some aspects are accurate in some philosophies and each philosophy has something to offer and no philosophy has every thing to offer. 

Both of the above are not tenable positions. The latter is perhaps more confusing than the former. Which points are to be taken from which philosophy and what are the reasons behind each of those? It boils down to personal likes and dislikes of each individual and prone to changes based on the changing likes and dislkes of that individual thus making the philosophical journey an aimless one. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

The followers of Dvaita are also dualists, who believe in the reality of Sriman Narayana as saguna brahmam... 

Siddhanta: 

Just a clarification. The term dualist is meant to believe in the difference between jīva and Paramātma, but not to believe in two Brahmas saguna Brahma and nirguņa Brahma. There is only one Brahma. The word guņa has multiple meanings. The same Brahma is sometimes referred as saguņa and sometimes as nirguņa. When the word saguņa is used, guņa means "auspicious quality". So, saguņa means One who has all the auspicious qualities. When the word nirguņa is used, guņa means "prākṛtika guņa (gross quality)". So, nirguņa means One who is devoid of any "prākṛtika guņa (gross quality)". He is nirdoșa jñāna ānandātmaka (flawless personification of knowledge and bliss). 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Dvaitins on the net have been vigorously asserting that they have 'vanquished' Visiṣṭādvaita (refer the official Dvaita website), and have compiled refutations of our tradition on their sites. The famous Dvaitin 'catchphrase' is that 21 bhashyas have been refuted by them, and they include EmperumAnAr's Sri Bhashyam in that. Now, we need not invite debates, but when we are 

are challenged, it is but proper that we come up with a suitable response. There is a dearth of articles on Dvaita as pUrvapaksha in Sri Vaishnava sites. We can remedy this. The other reason is that we need to popularize the great mahAns who have toiled to refute the Dvaita Siddhantha, and have authored great works. 

Siddhānta: 

We have discussed earlier that refutations of philosophies has been on-going across the time horizon. And the purvapaksin points out that such has been on-going between the vishitadvaita and dvaita traditions as well from both sides. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

Another primary motivation for this article is the fact that many Dvaitin scholars are not above personal insults and sometimes speak derogatory things about our great acharyas. While we shall not indulge in such mudslinging (I have the utmost respect for Madhva), it is necessary to counter this. 

Siddhanta: 

There is no second opinion that one must avoid derogatory remarks about acharyas of other schools, mudslinging of any kind and personal attacks of any kind in establishing a school or answering a set of objections. Such acts might show up in email chains, but scholarly works, meant to establish a philosophical position normally do not do that. See the works of Sri Jayatirtha, Sri Vyasatīrtha and Sri Vijayīndra. They did not do any of those. Even the most recent scholars, who wrote commentaries (Sri Satyadhyānatirtharu) never did any of those. I will be curious if any one points to any commentary that has such derogatory remarks. 

A sabha (Assembly), called Shri Vedānta Vimarsini, was conducted in the auspices of Sri Satyadhyānatīrtha in Sītāvilāsachatra of Mysore, which was attended by scholars from various schools. Some of the material for "sabhāsāra sangraha" was supplied by Sri V.N. 

Desikacharya. All the questions from all the schools were answered by Sri Satyadhyānatirtha. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Pancha Bheda Tattva 

The followers of Dvaita Vedanta believe in the doctrine of pancha bheda, namely: 

1) Difference between Isvara and Jivas. 

2) Difference between Isvara and Prakrti. 

3) Difference between Jivas and Prakrti. 

4) Difference between one piece of matter and another. 

5) Difference between individual jivas. 

This is the corner stone of their school, and they supplement it with ample pramAnAs. Let us look at the two most important points, namely, 1) and 5). 

Siddhanta: 

It is not just Dvaita, indirectly Visiṣṭādvaita also is forced to accept this. There is no escape for them. Why? Very simple. With their understanding that jīva is the śarīra of Iśvara and that Iśvara is aware of the difference between Him and his sarīra, there is difference between Iśvara and jīvas. Iśvara and jīvas are sentient and prakṛti is jaḍa or inert and so they must accept 2) and 3). They must be accepting 4) as well as there is difference between one jaḍa and another no matter how similar they are. The difference between individual jīvas is our anubhava and I am sure that they will not seek identity between their jīvas and the jivas of their gurus. When they are forced to accept all these, why are they trying to raise objections against these? If the objections are not for these points, then why bring these as objectionable points? 

So their approach of "corner stone" business itself is misplaced. From further arguments, it seems that their objections are placed somewhere else. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Bimba-Pratibimba 

The MAdhvAs explain that IsvarA is completely independent and each Jiva is dependent. However, rather than adopting the SarirAtma bhava for explaining the difference, they postulate a theory called Bimba- Pratibimba vada. According to this theory, the jivAs are as dependent on Sri Hari as the image in a mirror is dependent on the real object. In this way, each Jiva exists solely due to Sriman Narayana, just as an image does not exist without the object. Furthermore, just as an image in a mirror does not possess all the qualities of the object, the JIVA does not possess all qualities of IsvarA, but are inferior 

in all respects. 

(Eg. A mirror reflection looks like the real object, but cannot do the things that the object does. This should provide an indication of how inferior the JIVAS are, compared to paramAtmA). 

The pramāṇa-s given for this theory by MAdhvA, are Sruti statements such as the one below: 

Katopanishad (2-2-9): agnir-yathaiko bhuvanam pratish To rUpam rUpam pratirupo babhUva / 

ekastathA sarva-bhūtantarAtmA rUpam rUpam pratirUpo bahi Sca 

Just as fire, though one, having entered the world, assumes separate forms in respect of different shapes, similarly, the Self inside all beings, though one assumes a form in respect of each shape; and yet, it is outside 

A few Gita slokas are also given in support of this view. 

Curiously, these pramAnAs, according to Vishishtadvaitins, talk about the SharIrAtmabhava. For instance, the KatOpanishad vAkyA, ie, Bhagavan, possessing the JivA as His body, enters the Universe after Srushti, and assumes different forms based on karmA yet, Bhagavan remains detached from all this, since it is His body (namely, the JivA) that is enjoying the merits and demerits of karma. 

Siddhanta: 

The assertion that Bhagavan has jīva as His body is apramāņika. Not only is there no pramāņa for that, it even goes against all pramāņas. More over not even a tiny trace of sharIrAtmabhAva is present in the 

verse. 

yathA agniH 

= 

just as 

= 

fire god or agni deva (presiding deity of fire) ekaH = only one 

bhuvanam prviShTo = entered the world 

rUpaм rUpam = every form (of fire) 

pratirUpo babhuva = became pratibimba (of fire) 

tathA = similarly 

= 

sarva-bhUtAnatarAtmA One who is inner-controller (Lord) of all 

beings 

= 

eka H rUpaM rUpam 

only one 

= 

every form (of Jiva) 

pratirUpo babhUva = became pratibimba (of Lord) 

bahishcha 

= 

also outside (meaning different) 

(A is outside B means A is different from B) 

It is a straight forward thing. 

Where did "assumes separate forms in respect of different shapes" and "assumes a form in respect of each shape" come from? 

Further, "this assuming a form with respect to shapes" has nothing to do with shariratmabhava. Atma does not have a shape. So, sharIra does not assume a form in respect of Atma. SharIra has a shape, but Atma does not assume a form in respect of sharIra. 

In addition, one can note the following logical issues as well in their approcah. 

Let us list four possibilities 

1. Bhagavan is bimba and jīva are precisely Pratibimba. 

2. Bhagavān is like bimba and jīva are not exactly Pratibimba, but they are 

like Pratibimba, in the sense that jīva has dependency on Bhagavan and 

possesses some of the charactaristics of Bhagavān. 

3. Jīva is the body of Bhagavan. 

4. Jiva is like the body of Bhagavan in the sense that Bhagavān is inside the 

jīva. 

Both 1. and 2. do not attribute any flaw to Bhagavān. 4. also does not attribute any flaw to Bhagavan as it is drawing only a comparison. But the position 3. taken by Visiṣṭādvaita attributes many flaws to Bhagavān. 

1. Bhagavān has one extra layer than jīva and so is worse off. Even granting that Bhagavan does not have any abhimāna for his body (namely jīva and other bodies of jiva), nevertheless, He is equipped with the bodies. 

2. While going to mokṣa, jīva has cast off all his bodies, but Bhagavān has jīva as His body and so in a way He has eternal bondage of the bodies. That too in mokṣa itself, He has as many bodies as the jivas in mokṣa. 

3. The jivas have the property of dehanaşa (or destruction of body). Now the Lord has jīva as the body. Even though jiva has no destruction, his bodies are undergoing destruction. This means these bodies, which are also effectively the bodies of Bhagavān are also undergoing destruction. That means Bhagavān also has the flaw of "dehanāṣa" 

4. Not only jiva, but the Visiṣṭādvaitins also claim that Jagat is the body of Bhagavan. That means when the Jagat is destroyed during Pralaya, that also is effectively dehanāṣa for Bhagavān. 

5. Their argument is that Bhagavan is inside the jiva and so jiva is the body. By such an argument a person who is inside the house should be taken as having the house as the body. 

6. Sri Krishna says in Gīta - 

avajānanti mām mūḍhā mānuṣim tanumāśritam | paraṁ bhāvamajānanto mama bhūtamaheśvaram || 

अवजानन्ति माम् मूढा मानुषीम् तनुमाश्रितम् । 

परम् भावमजानन्तो मम भूतमहेश्वरम् ॥ 

Gitā 

- 

- 9-11 

गीता -९-११ 

It is horrible to think that the Lord has this kind of panchabhautika deha, since the bodies of the jiva are also effectively the bodies of Paramātma and Sri Krishna condemns such an idea. 

7. Since there are all kinds of animals, birds, trees and insects and other living beings, God having those jīvas also as His bodies, must be construed as having their bodies also as His bodies. 

8. The Gita verse says 

antavanta ime dehā nityasyoktāḥ śarīriņaḥ | anāśino'prameyasya tasmādyudhyasva bhārata || 

Gītā 

2-18 

अन्तवन्त इमे देहा नित्यस्योक्ताः शरीरिणः । 

अनाशिनोऽप्रमेयस्य तस्माद्युध्यस्व भारत॥ 

गीता - २ - १८ 

The bodies of this eternal embodied one are destructible. Thus Oh, Arjuna perform your duty of doing the war. 

Here if the Lord is embodied one and jīva is the body of the eternal Lord, then this word would imply that the jīva (which is the body of the Lord) becomes destructible. But the intent of the verse is to say that the bodies of the jīva are destructible, but jiva is eternal. That means this verse will result in self-contradiction that the eternal jīva is destructible. 

Let us grant that in all the above cases, He has no attachment to any of His bodies. That will only put Him in "jīvanmukta" state, but will not take away any of those flaws. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Madhva's intention was to show the complete and absolute difference between JivA and ParamAtmA. He could not tolerate even the 

inseparability, ie, Aprtak SiddhI, between JivA and ParamAtMa, as a result of the SarirAtma bhava. This is the reason for the unique theory of Bimba Pratibimba Vada. 

Siddhanta: 

Let us first discuss the confusion between absolute difference and separability. 

Let us list all four possibilities. 

1. Two objects are absolutely different and separable 

2. Two objects are absolutely different and inseparable 

3. Two objects are non-different and inseparable 

4. Two objects are non-different and separable. 

The cases 1. and 2. are possible. 

The cases 3. is trivial and 4. is impossible and so 3. and 4. need not even be considered. Thus apart from 1. and 2., only the other possibility is that the jīva and Brahman are non-different and that is the position taken by Advaita. 

It is wrong to think that two entities, which are absolutely different cannot have inseparability. 

It is wrong to think that Sri Madhvācārya "could not tolerate even the inseparability.". That can result only from serious misunderstanding of not only Dvaita philosophy, but of the śastras in general. The inseparability has been stressed ad nauseum and our Acharya has stressed that ad nauseum.

गीताभाष्य - २-१८ 

A reflection can get destroyed for 3 reasons 

1. By the destruction of the main object 

— 

2. By the destruction of the reflecting medium (Upādhi) 

3. By moving the mirror out of the main object's realm (sannidhi nāśa) 

1. is not possible because the Lord is eternal. 

2. is not possible because the jīva itself is the medium, who is eternal. 

3. is not possible because the Lord is all-pervading. 

This emphasizes in unequivocal terms the inseparability of jiva and 

Paramātma. 

The following pramāņa-s clearly indicate Bimba Pratibimba bhāva 

Kathopanişat (कठोपनिषत्) says

"The deity Agni enters all the worlds and performs all activities of the fire. All the inert fires are but reflections of this unique sentient God of fire, Agni. Likewise, the Supreme Lord is the unique sentient being that pervades as the indwelling independent force of all the Jivas. Hence the jīvas are different from Lord. 

The deity Vayu enters all the worlds and performs all activities of the fire. All the inert Life-forces are but reflections of this unique sentient God of Life, Vayu. Likewise, the Supreme Lord is the unique sentient being that pervades as the indwelling independent force of all the Jivas. Hence the jivas are different from Lord."

Here three kinds of creation are mentioned.

The Lord creates His own forms - which is like 

lighting one lamp from another every lamp is full and so every avatāra of Lord is full. When one lamp is lit from another lamp, the prior one does not diminish. 

sxsti (जीवसृष्टि ) 

Jīva sṛṣṭi ye) - Jivas are pratibimbas and so vāri (water) is mentioned. He gives bodies for his pratibimba jīvas. 

jaga srsti (जडसृष्टि)

It is like transforming mud into pots

The following quote from Kurma purāna ( कूर्मपुराण) says 

"cetanābhāsako jīvaḥ paramaścetano hariḥ | svatantratvāt svatantro hi naiva dosena lipyate ||" 

चेतनाभासको जीवः परमश्चेतनो हरिः ।

"The tiny jiva is alpa cetana and just reflection of paramacetana Sri Hari, because He is independent. Due to His independence, even though He is present inside the jiva, He is untouched by the flaws like. sorrow. " 

The Varāha purāna ( वराहपुराण) says

वराह पुराण 

"The deities like Brahma, are but reflections of the Supreme Lord Sri Hari. Their bliss is very little compared to the infinite bliss of the Lord." 

(Note that this not only tells bimba-pratibimbabhāva, but also refutes Ananda sāmya, more about that later.) 

In the following Brahmasutra, the bimba pratibimbabhāva only is indicated. 

"OM ābhāsa eva ca OM" 

ॐ आभास एव च ॐ 

— 

Brahmasūtra - 2-3-50 

- ब्रह्मसूत्र २-३-५० 

"The jiva is pratibimba of the Lord only." 

Thus there are scriptural statements that support "Bimba-pratibimba bhāva" and there are no scriptural statements that contradict "Bimba-pratibimba bhāva" and so there is no need for any alternate explanation. 

On the other hand, there are no scriptural statements that say that Lord has jīva as the body or the universe as the body and there are scriptural statements that contradict the Lord literally having a body different from him. Thus trying to treat the Lord as "sariri" by using statements quoted before will go against many scriptural statements and also turns out to be illogical. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Jiva Bheda 

Furthermore, the outcome of Bimba Pratibimba is extended to the jiva bheda as well. 

Siddhanta: 

The outcome of Bimba Pratibimbabhāva bhāva does not have to be "extended" to the jiva bheda. The jiva bheda is pratyakṣasiddha. And also it is Agama siddha. And also it is anumānasiddha. 

1. Pratyakṣasiddha: 

When jīva itself is not pratyakṣagocara, how can their bheda be pratyakṣasiddha? 

The people that we see in this world are all different. If the same jiva is present in all the people, then the pain that is felt by any jīva should be felt by every other jīva in this universe. That is unseen and unsupported. Thus they have to be different. 

The Visiṣṭādvaitins themselves would not like to equate themselves with the jiva of their preacher Sri Rāmānuja. Much less would they like to equate the jiva of kalipuruşa or any other despicable jiva with that of Sri Rāmānuja. They are forced to accept jiva-jiva bheda.

These are just as "sthālīpulākanyāya (स्थालीपुलाकन्याय)". The Bhagavadgīta 

is replete with statements that bring out the difference among jīvas. 

In His Viśvarupa, The Lord shows Adityas, Rudras, Vasus and all kinds of jivas. 

The difference among jīvas is given in scriptures. 

Look at the Sutra 

- 

which explains why there are differences. 

- 

Brahmasūtra - 2-3-51 

OM adṛṣṭāniyamāt OM 

ॐ अदृष्टानियमात् ॐ 

- ब्रह्मसूत्र - २ - ३ - ५१ 

If a doubt arises that since all the jīvas are pratibimbas of the Lord, they all must resemble one another and must be the same, this sūtra answers that doubt saying that the difference is due to difference in their inherent svabhāva, samskāras and the consequent anādi karma, which are ādrsta. 

2. anumānasiddha : 

We see in our daily lives enormous differences in various people. Leave alone people we also see all kinds of living organisms, which indicate difference among jivas. The Visiṣṭādvaita position that all the jīvas are the same to start with and then undergo this enormous difference and at the end all reach the same kind of mokṣa enjoying 

the same amount of bliss equivalent to the Lord is dead against logic and the Dvaita position that there are differences to start with 

(from beginning-less time) and there are differences as we perceive them today and will reach their respective destinations is sarva pramāņa siddha. 

In fact, it would not make sense that jivas like Hitler and Duryodhana reach the same destination as jīvas like Brahma, Vāyu, Garuda and Indra. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

MAdhvAs argue that all JivAs are not the same. JivAs can be sattvik, rajasic and tamasic. This difference is basically due to the SvarUpa itself, ie, their essential nature. 

Sattvik JivAs get liberation, whereas tamasic jivAs get eternal hell, ie, their stay in samsArA is permanent. 

Siddhanta: 

Mādhvās clearly point out these well established facts from the scriptures. In simplest terms, one can go thru Gīta and see them for themselves. Some of these Gita verses are pointed below. 

Please note that eternal hell is not "permanent stay in saMsāra". If those two are the same, then our saMsāra must be termed as "short term super-hell". 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The cruel fate of the tamasic jivAs is not attributable to partiality of Sriman Narayana, because the difference in SvarUpa is the JivA's own nature, and as such, Bhagavan is not responsible, since He did not create JivAs. The pramAnAs for this is: 

"Those who are hateful towards me, are cruel and the worst humans in the world; them I forever hurl only into demonic species. Having reached evil species in birth after birth, the fools; completely failing to reach me, only, they then go to the lowest state. - Gita 16.19-20. 

Siddhānta: 

Ofcourse. And not just these verses, there are many verses, which describe the variation of the jivas and the difference in destinations. 

The following verses mention eternal hell and mokṣa and instructs what to do to get to mokṣa.

"These cruel haters, worst of men, I always throw them into saMsāra (cycles of birth and death) and into demonical wombs. 

Then O Kunti's son, these fools, having acquired the demonical wombs, recursively every birth, never reach me and attain the abysmal hellish realms. 

There are three doors that open to three kinds of hells in the form of self-degeneration lust, fury and greed. Hence one must forsake these 

three. 

- 

O Kaunteya, one who is free from these three dark doors, indulges in what is for his own welfare and eventually reaches the supreme goal. 

One who forsakes the injunctions of sastra-s and goes one's own merry way, never acquires perfection, true joy and supreme goal." 

COMMENT: In fact the last three chapters of the Gita, the daivasura sampat vibhaga yoga, the shraddha traya vibhaga and the moxa sannyasa chapters clinch the issue of the jiva traividhya and by extension jiva jiva bheda for the informed reader 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

MAdhvA gives a unique interpretation of Gita 9.32, According to him, all the IthihAsAs and PurAnAs talk of men becoming women in their next birth, but there is absolutely no instance of a woman becoming a man in her next birth. For instance, the rishis of DandakAranyA became gopis, but AmbA only became a eunuch, ie, Sikhandi, and did not become a man. This is due to intrinsic differences in the gender of JivAs. A very radical theory of gender bheda is also postulated by MAdhvA. 

Siddhanta: 

Acharya Madhva never said that all the men become women in their next birth. If that were the case all the male devatas would have been 

born as women. 

If one likes to see the enormous difference between the glorious interpretation given by Acharya Madhva and other Acharyas for the Gita verse 9,32, here it goes. When others gave with the apparent meaning, which is not only ridiculous, but brings down the stature of the women of our tradition, the true purport is brought out by our Acharya. 

māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye'pi syuḥ pāpayonayaḥ | striyo vaiśyāstathā śūdrāste'pi yanti parāṁ gatim ||

"mām hi yasmāt pārtha vyapāśritya mām āśrayatvena gṛhītvā ye'pi syuḥ bhaveyuḥ pāpayonayaḥ pāpā yoniḥ yeṣāṁ te pāpayonayaḥ pāpajanmānaḥ ke te ityāha striyaḥ vaiśyāḥ tathā śūdrāḥ te api yanti gacchanti parāṁ prakṛṣṭām gatim |

शन्करभाष्य 

"Seeking refuge in Me (Being dependent on Me), even people of low or sinful birth women, artisans, and serfs - achieve the supreme destination of blissful liberation." 

— 

- 

Sri Rāmānuja's is not very different and has the following commentary 

striyaḥ vaiśyāḥ śūdrāḥ ca papayonayaḥ api mām vyapāśritya parām gatim yānti | 

Rāmānujabhāṣya 

—

रामानुजभाष्य 

"The women, artisans, and serfs and other evil birth ones attain the supreme state of blissful liberation state". 

Both of them in the next verse 

kim punarbrāhmaṇāḥ puṇyā bhaktā rājarṣayastathā | anityamasukhaṁ lokamimaṁ prāpya bhajasva mām || 

किम् पुनर्ब्राह्मणाः पुण्या भक्ता राजर्षयस्तथा ।

अनित्यमसुखम् लोकमिमम् प्राप्य भजस्व माम् ॥ 

गीता - ९-३३ 

indicate that Brāhmaṇas and others are punyayonayaḥ (born meritorious). 

That means both of them indicated that the women and śūdras can never be punyayoni ones. 

Quite magnificently Acharya explains these two verses by simply quoting the Bhaviṣyatparva 

— 

"pāpādi kāritāścaiva puṁsāṁ svābhāvikā api |

Madhvabhāşhya for 9-32 

AMCHIA TRI: 4IYgıdırzì fagrifdze: || 

सर्वेषामपि जीवानामन्त्यदेहो यथा निजः । 

मुक्तौ च निजभावः स्यात् कर्मभोगांस्ततोऽपि च ॥ 

इति भविष्यत्पर्ववचनात् पापयोनयः पुण्या इति विशेषणम् 

मध्वभाष्य - ९-३२ 

"Those who are men and are Vipra, Kṣatriya, Vaiśya and śūdra, by svabhāva (inherent nature), may due to their sins or kāma filled acts, be born as women or Ksatriyas, etc. However those who are inherently women are never born as men. The only way they can obtain male body is by sharing the body with a male soul from boons, etc. Those who are inherently women and born as women are much superior to males acquiring female bodies. The inherent nature, be it manhood, or womanhood, or Brāhmaṇatva or Ksatriyatva, etc as per their inherent nature are retained in the liberated state, having fulfilled all prārabdha." 

Thus from the words of Bhaviṣyatparva, the qualifiers like "papayonis" and "punya-s" are to be understood. 

Sudyumna was born as woman due to sinful act. Agniputras were born as women due to kāma or desire. 

The wrong information that śikhandi is a eunuch is based on TV shows and video shows. The misinformation is a product of absence of knowledge from the scriptures. It is a shame that they project him as eunuch and it is worse that people take that as authority. 

Note the following information from Mula Mahābhārata itself. 

Bhiṣma narrates to Duryodhana the episode of sikhaṇḍi. 

"strilingam dhārayāmāsa sthūņo yakṣo'tha bhārata | yakṣarūpam ca taddiptam sikhaṇḍī pratyapadyata ||

"O Bharata, the Yakṣa Sthūņa took upon himself the feminity and śikhaṇḍi obtained the effulgent Yakṣa male form. 

Thereupon the Panchala prince śikhaṇḍi, acquiring the manhood, entered his city with great joy and went to his father." 

"tataḥ sa rājā drupadasya śrutvā vimarśayukto yuvatirvariṣṭā | sampreṣayāmāsa sucārurūpāḥ śikhaṇḍiņam strīpumānveti vettum ||

महाभारत - ५-१९२-२९ 

"Thereupon that king (The father of sikhaṇḍi's wife is the king of dāśārṇa), hearing the words of Drupada, critical of the situation, sent forth best of the damsels, who were beautiful, to test whether śikhaṇḍi is man or woman. 

O chief of the Kauravas, those damsels, that were dispatched, learnt the truth and were highly pleased. They conveyed to the king of Dāśārņa that śikhandi was a man of great strength and impressive stature." 

Further in Bhiṣmaparva, Mahābhārata mentions śikhaṇḍi as Mahārathi and describes how he fights a fierce battle. 

So all these pramāņa-s clearly indicate that he never had a eunuch's body. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Please refer Sri Tirukallam Swami's Gita Saram to get a comparison of Sri Rāmānuja's and Sri Madhva's views (Sri Sankara's interpretation is also given). The sloka simply states that Brahmanas have both Bhakti Yoga and Prapatti as paths, whereas women, vaishyas and sudras perform prapatti to attain him. These people lack VedhAdhikArA. The Vaishya cannot perform the rite called satra yagna. This is Sri Rāmānuja's viewpoint.Siddhanta: 

All three commentaries were given above and they are pretty much self-explanatory. 

The śloka uses the words "papayonayaḥ", "striyaḥ", "Vaiśyāḥ" and "śūdrāḥ". 

What Sri Shankaracharya did was to interpret "papayonayaḥ" as "women", "Vaiśyas" and "śūdras". What Sri Rāmānuja did was to group "pāpayonayaḥ" and "women", "Vaisyas" and "śūdras" into one. In both cases, there is no clue how to avoid equating those category people and papayonis. In effect they are belittling these people in entirety subjecting all of them to a scornful treatment. The slokas dont have any Bhaktiyoga and Prapatti and Sri Rāmānuja also did not make any effort to use those words in the commentary of these verses. So, trying to drag what is not in the verses and also not in the commentary of their Acharya is uncalled for. 

Sri Madhvācārya averted the disaster of demeaning and degrading the entire group. 

Let me further explain this concept with mathematical notation. 

Svābhāvika refers to inherent nature. Aupādhika refers to physical birth. 

S-W = Svābhāvika woman 

= 

S-M-P Svābhāvika man, who committed certain kind of papa that begets him Aupadhika womanhood say A-W-P 

S-M-Q 

= 

Svābhāvika man, who did not commit that kind of papa that begets him Aupadhika womanhood and so he will become A-M-Q S-B-P = Svābhāvika Brāhmaṇa, who committed certain kind of papa that begets him Aupadhika Vaiśyatva or sūdratva (say A-V-P or A-S-P) S-B-Q Svābhāvika Brāhmaṇa, who did not commit that kind of papa that begets him Aupādhika Vaiśyatva or śūdratva and so he will become A-B-Q 

= 

By extension, one can imagine S-K-P and S-K-Q for Kṣatriayas, etc. 

S-W ==> A-W 

S-M-P ==> A-W-P 

(1) (2) 

S-M-Q ==> A-M-Q 

(3) 

S-B-P ==> A-V-P or A-S-P 

(4) 

S-B-Q ==> A-B-Q 

(5) 

S-K-P ==> A-V-P or A-S-P 

(6) 

S-K-Q ==> A-K-Q 

(7) 

S-V-P ==> A-S-P 

(8) 

S-V-Q ==> A-V-Q 

(9) 

S-S 

==> A-S 

10) 

Note that majority of women (who come under (1)) are not pāpayonis. 

Most of the śūdras (who come under (10)) are not pāpayonis 

A much smaller number (who come under (2), (4), (6) and (8)) are pāpayonis. 

Note that because of certain type of pāpa, some are born in those yonis, which are unnatural to them, and so called papayonis. 

It is not that just because they are born in those yonis, they are pāpayonis. 

A birth in a yoni itself does not give pāpa, but certain type of pāpa can give birth in a yoni. 

COMMENT: The fact that the jivas have a gender is sufficient to point to a jiva-jiva bheda, a point sometimes missed if this is not well understood. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Nature of IsvarA 

— 

Doctrine of Visesa 

IsvarA is accepted as the possessor of all auspicious qualities. But MAdhvAs differ from Vishishtadvaitins on the issue of the identity of substrate and attributes. 

Siddhanta: 

It is scriptures, which differ from Visiṣṭādvaitins. 

The śrutis declare "anandam brahmaṇo vidvān" (4 яguìì faal) 

"atha eşa eva parama ānandaḥ" अथ एष एव परम आनन्दः), 

"ekamevādvitiyam" 

(एकमेवाद्वितीयम्), 

"neha nānāsti kiñcana" (नेह नानास्ति किचन ). 

· 

There is no difference between Lord and His attributes. There is no difference between Lord and His avayavas (or limbs). 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

According to MAdhvAs, the attributes of IsvarA are not distinct from Him, and constitute His essential nature. This is because when we say that there is a difference between substrate and attribute, it can be argued 'what is the difference between this difference and the substrate?' and so on ad infinitum. To avoid this regress, visesa is postulated. Essentially, it states that a thing and its qualities are identical, but can be spoken of as different things. Eg: We say Vişņu's Lotus Feet. This implies a difference between Bhagavan and His Lotus Feet. However, if we just say 'Viṣṇu', it includes everything, such as His lotus feet. Hence, we speak of the lotus feet as though it is different from the entity, but in actuality, it is identical to the entity. 

Vishishtadvaitins argue that a substrate and its attributes are different from each other. More on that later. 

Siddhanta: 

The logical inconsistency thru infinite regress is given as an additional proof only. 

There are many scriptural statements as indicated above. Please take a look 

at the Brahmasutras in Parānandādhikarana (परानन्दाधिकरण), 

sthānaviśeŞādhikarana ( स्थानविशेषाधिकरण ) and 

(अहिकुण्डलाधिकरण) 

ahikuṇḍalādhikaraṇa (el) (which will be explained a bit later). All of them completely refute the Viśiṣṭādvaita position in 

Anandasāmya (आनन्दसाम्य) and viśesanirākarana (विशेषनिराकरण). The Lord's 

niravayavatva is accepted by even Advaitins. There is no other way 

out. 

Commenting on "aṁśādhikaraṇa (3)", Sri Shankaracharya says 

"jivaḥ iśvarasyāṁśo bhavi tumarhati yathāgnerviṣphulingaḥ | amsa ivāṁśo | hi niravayavasya mukhyo'mśaḥ sambhavati|" 

śankarabhāṣya 

जीवः ईश्वरस्यांशो भवितुमर्हति यथाग्नेर्विष्फुलिङ्गः। अंश इवांशो। न हि निरवयवस्य मुख्योऽ ंशः सम्भवति । 

- 

शन्करभाष्य 

The commentator Bhāmatīkara further comments 

"jivo brahmāṁśa iva tattantratayā natvaṁśaḥ" 

जीवो ब्रह्मांश इव तत्तन्त्रतया नत्वंशः 

Bhāmatīkāra 

- भामतीकार 

"The jiva can be amśa of the Lord just like the the spark of the fire. It only means jīva resembles the amsa, but in reality it is not amśa as it is impossible to be an amśa of "niravayava" Lord - Lord can not be split into parts. 

"Because jiva is controlled by Brahman, it is called as amsa, but in reality 

it is not an amsa". 

Pūrvapaksa: 

Loose Ends 

All important points have been covered. A few extras: 

1) MAdhvAs do not accept the theory of Nitya Suris. Only Lakṣmi is Nitya Mukta (because of Her intrinsic nature) but no-one else. So, this means for MAdhvAs, Adi Sesha and Garuda are Baddha JivAs. 

Siddhanta: 

The Visiṣṭādvaita position of Nityasuris will lead to lot of difficulties. It will also be explained later. It is not "for Madhvas", but it is as per the pramāṇa-s. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

2) MAdhvAs do not accept the Sat KhyAti VAdA theory of error, as propounded by Vishishtadvaitins, but endorse AnyathA KhyAti. More on that later. 

Siddhanta: 

The Visiṣṭādvaita position of Khyāti Vāda will lead to lot of difficulties. It will also be explained later. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

3) MAdhvAs do not accept the theory of avEsha avatara. Vyasa, for instance, is a purna avatArA. 

Siddhanta: 

This indeed, is a strange argument. This is like saying "Mr. X does not believe in any flying objects. He makes his living by working as a pilot of an airplane". How can any one say " MAdhvAs do not accept the theory of avEsha avatara. Vyasa, for instance, is a purna avatArA" ? 

Leave alone the inconsistency of logic, it is completely wrong statement also. 

Mādhvās not only accept the theory of aveśa and avatāra, they are very precise and give enormous weightage to it. 

In fact, they explain aveśa and avatāra of the Lord and also other deities. For other deities, the avatāras can be just amsa. In case of the Lord, as He is always "pūrṇa", His amśa is also pūrņa as His avatāra. But when it comes to aveśa (which is just lending some special power), just aveśa need not be avatāra. 

For example, the Lord's āveśa is there in Balarama (who is actually an incarnation of seṣa). 

Dvaita explains that thinking an avatara of the Lord as non-avatāra or non--avatāra of the Lord as avatāra constitutes one of the nine kinds of dveṣa. 

The Visiṣṭādvaita believes in partial avatāra of the Lord by going against the śruti pramāṇa 

1 

"pūrṇamadaḥ pūrṇamidam pūrṇātpurṇamudacyate | 

pūrṇasya pūrṇamādāya pūrṇamevāvasiṣyate ||" 

पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदम् पूर्णात्पूर्णमुदच्यते । 

पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ॥ 

Even logically also, a fraction of infinity is also infinity only. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

They also do not accept that the archa thirumeni of the Lord is Suddha Sattvam. 

Siddhānta: 

The Visiṣṭādvaita believes in "archa avatāra" and they think that the icon of the Lord is an incarnation of the Lord. Dvaita position is that the icon can have special sannidhana and be a special adhiṣṭhāna of the Lord in the same space that the icon is occupying. In other words, the Lord's special presence is there and this varies based on many factors like the icon being svayambhu, the tapaśśakti of the one doing pratiṣṭha, the place, the process of pratiṣṭha using mantras, the devotion of the devotees coming and praying, etc. Of course, all these are as per the will of the Lord. 

Let us look at what makes sense and what does not. 

Firstly, we know that as the sculptor is making the icon, he may sit on it, he may step on it and treat it as if it is a toy in his hand. For him it is an important task to be completed. So, does that mean he is actually doing all this to avatāra of the Lord. Let us assume that after the pratistha, it suddenly becomes the avatara. Then we also saw that during Muslim regime, the muslims broke many icons. Does that mean that they broke the "avatara-s of the Lord"? If one thinks that they are not avatāra-s, but just "śuddha satvam", do the muslims have capacity to destroy "śuddha satvam"? Otoh, if we think of "sannidhāna" as per the will of the Lord, then there can be two possibilities 

1. There was no sannidhāna of the Lord already and the muslims could break them. 

2. There was sannidhāna of the Lord, but before the act of muslims, the Lord took out the sannidhāna and allowed the muslims to cause the 

destruction. 

Do they think that the icon was "śuddha sattva" from the beginning (meaning the stone was made of suddha sattva and the icon was made from śuddha sattva or it becomes śuddha sattva at the time of "pratiṣṭha"? In either case, they face the following difficulty. 

If they think that the icon is not avatāra, but just "suddha sattva", even then, how can the muslims or other vandals have the capacity to destroy "śuddha sattva"? 

We must not get mixed up between sannidhāna and avatara and suddha 

sattva. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

— 

The Vijayindra ParAjayA is a wonderful work in defense of Vishishtadvaita. It has 5 chapters, but is extremely rare. Adiyen possesses the english translation of 2 chapters, one refuting visesa and another refuting ananda tAratamya. SrinivAsAchAryA has also authored Ananda TAratamya Khandana, but this is a more comprehensive work. The period of VijayanagarA was extremely interesting. The debates between the three schools were fierce. There were 3 major scholars Appayya Dikshitar for Advaita, ParakAla Yati for Vishishtadvaita and Vijayindra Tirtha for Dvaita. The headquarters of the latter two was in Kumbakonam, near our ArAvamudhan koil. Vijayindra Tirtha was leading the MAdhvA population of Tamil Nadu at the time. He is also reported to have settled a dispute when the Saiva temple in Kumbakonam claimed that the pushkarini of SArangapAni belonged to their temple. The debates between these three were wonderful and triangular. Each scholar attempted to refute the other two simultaneously, which lead to some very interesting debates. All 3 were well matched, but in the end Appayya Dikshitar was defeated by both Vijayindra Tirtha and ParakAla Yati (later on by DoddAchAryA). ParakAla Yati also refuted Vijayindra Tirtha's objections to 

Vishishtadvaita. 

Siddhanta: 

These false stories against the historical truth are spread needlessly. Sri Vyāsatīrtharu successfully refuted in his work Candrika a few positions taken by Visiṣṭādvaita. They attempted criticisms of that work. Sri Vijayīndratīrtha 

wrote a work called "Sarva-siddhānta-sārāsāra-vivecanam (H-M-URIER- (सर्व-सिद्धान्त-सारासार- 

f) (1 and 2)". In Sarva-siddhānta-sārāsāra-vivecanam-1, Sri Vijayindratirtharu refutes the criticisms of Visiṣṭādvaita. Sri Tatacharya also known as Sri Parakāla yati wrote a work "Vijayindra Parājaya" attempting a refutation. However those criticisms have already been effectively anticipated and addressed by Sri Vijayindratīrtha in his Sarva-siddhānta-sārāsāra-vivecanam-1 itself. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Though Dvaitins do not accept that Vijayindra Tirtha was ever defeated, the obvious fact is that until today, there has been no reply or rebuttal to the Vijayindra ParAjaya. Some modern day Dvaitins have attempted a rebuttal (BN Hebbar), but it is clearly an inferior work, with poor understanding of Vishishtadvaita. Let us celebrate the victory of Parakala Yati, who comes in the sishya paramparai of Kavi TArkika Simham, the renowned VedAnta Desikan himself. 

Siddhanta: 

What an argument? Just because Sri Parakala yati wrote a work named "Vijayindra Parajaya" and a false claim that there had not been an effective rebuttal, one tries to conclude that Sri Vijayīndra tīrtharu was defeated, then look at the following. Sri Vijayīndra tīrtharu wrote a work called "Appayya-kapola-capețika" (which means "a slap on the cheek of Sri Appayya Dikṣita"). Saying that there is no effective rebuttal, can we conclude that Sri Vijayīndratirtha went and physically slapped Sri Appayya Dikṣita? In spite of such vigorous philosophical exchanges, they maintained a very cordial relationship till end on personal level. 

For more details regarding polemic criticisms and exchanges between Dvaita and Visiṣṭādvaita, please refer to pages 405-407 of "History of the Dvaita School of Vedanta" by Dr. BNK Sharma. 

Further looking at the strawman arguments of Sri Parakala yati in "Vijayindra Parājaya", one can imagine, why many scholars ignored that work. There is no end to all kinds of claims. The Advaita camp claims that Sri Parakala yati was defeated by Sri Appayya Dikṣita. Instead of running after all those claims and instead of blindly labeling "this is inferior, that is inferior", let us address the core issues with an open mind. Sri Satyadhyānatīrtha refuted in open sabha all the objections of the Visiṣṭādvaita scholars. Further in the commentary "Bhāvadipa" on Tatvaprakāśika of Sri Jayatirtha, Sri Raghavendraswamy refutes the objections of Sri Parakāla yati. Thus in light of all these 

"Parakāla-yati-kṛta-Vijayīndra-parājaya-paramarśaḥ 

— 

parāstah eva" (परकाल-यति-कृत-विजयीन्द्र-पराजय- परमर्शः परास्तः एव ) The assaulting 

conclusion of Parakāla yati that he defeated Sri Vijayīndratīrtha is to be rejected only). So, celebrating an imaginary victory is only a false sense of joy. 

The purpose of this write-up is to answer all the objections of Visiṣṭādvaita. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The non-difference between a substrate and its attributes is refuted in the Vijayendra ParAjaya. ParakAla Yati bases himself on the Tattva Mukta KalapA of VedAnta Desikan. 

He uses the example of "blue jug". The MAdhvAs think that the conception of the jug carries all its qualities, such as the blue color and these qualities have no separate existence from it. In other words, we can say blue jug, but when we say 'jug', it itself includes the quality of blueness in it. Hence, blueness is identical with the jug, but is spoken of differently. 

Siddhanta: 

I don't know if this person is misquoting Sri Parakāla Yati or if Sri Parakala yati himself says that. It sounds more like the latter as confirmed by another statement given further below. It is a clear misrepresentation of the whole thing. Acharya Madhva clearly and emphatically explains visesa in the Gitatatparya great yatis of the tradition such as Sri Jayatirtha, Sri Vyasa Tirtha and Sri Raghavendra Swamy have followed the same and it is pratyakṣasiddha and drives home the point very clearly. 

First of all, one must differentiate between cetana (sentient) and jada (inert). 

In case of cetana, everything that is inherent of cetana is non- different from cetana as that cetana is "acchedya (Note the Gita verse)". In case of jada, the attributes are of two kinds 

"yāvaddravyabhāvi" (a) (lasts as long as the object lasts) and 

"ayāvaddravyabhāvi" (a) (does not last as long as the object lats). In case of "yavaddravyabhāvi", there is non-difference. In case of "ayāvaddravyabhāvi", there is both difference and non- difference difference in one aspect and non-difference in another. In case of such attributes, those attributes may have been lost either naturally or through manual intervention. More later. 

— 

Pūrvapaksa: 

This is refuted as follows. A normal (colorless) jug may assume a blue color on heating or by any treatment, so we know that the quality stands out from the jug, and hence is different from the jug. 

Siddhanta: 

There is no need to go thru that much trouble to give an example, where an "inseparable attribute" is getting destroyed. Take a green banana or a green mango. As they become ripe, the greenness vanishes 

and they assume yellowness (just like the jug assuming blueness). The Pūrvapakṣa claims 

1. The greenness or yellowness or whiteness or blueness, etc. are not banana itself or mango itself or jar itself. 

2. There are so many other blue objects, green objects and yellow objects. 

3. There are bananas and mangoes which are not green. There are also bananas and mangos which are not yellow. There are jars which are blue and there jars which are not blue. 

4. This means these colors and these objects are different. They can not be said to be non-different. 

1., 2. and 3. are true. 4. has to be analyzed properly. 

When the colors are present, can the color alone be separated from the object. Surely, one can destroy the colors, but not give a separate existence to those colors of those objects, as and when they are in the inherent nature of the object. 

One agrees that jarness cannot be separated from jar. Banana-ness cannot be separated from Banana and mango-ness can not be separated from mango just as cow-ness cannot be separated from cow. 

Suppose a jar had a handle. The handle was part of the jar. The handle is not different from jar and at the same time the handle is not same as the jar. The handle is part of the jar and at the same time the handle is different from the jar. It only depends on how one looks at it. Suppose the handle broke. Still one calls the jar "a jar" (It is just that it does not have a handle any more). 

— 

The concept can be seen even more clearly with cloth and its threads. Are the threads same as the cloth or different from the cloth. One tends to say "thread is not same as the cloth. They are different". Then take away all the threads, the cloth is also gone. Suppose one says they are the same. Then put just a pile of threads one doesn't call it a cloth. There is kāryakāraṇabheda (one is a product produced from other), but not "vastutaḥ bheda". This is the case for jaḍas. The total aggregate of the attributes makes up the object. Each attribute is an amsa of the object and is inseparable from that. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The quality of color has the jug as its support and hence, may flow into it or not depending on circumstances. 

Siddhanta: 

The color never flows into the object. It is either integral part or 

external (like one wraps an object with a color paper, then one can remove the paper so the color is gone, but there it is not integral part of the object.) 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

It is wrong to state that the inseparability of the jug from the color is the essential nature of the jug that determines the incoming quality, for the present dispute is ABOUT the existence of such an inseparable association. 

Siddhānta: 

This is incorrect. If it is the quality, how can it come in. The quality is inherent for an object. If the quality is external to the object and some X1 brings an association between the quality and the object, then they needs another entity (say X2) that brings association between the object and X1. Then they need another X3 that brings association between X2 and the object. Thus they will end up in infinite regress. They are forced to accept viseșa to extricate themselves from infinite regress. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The MAdhvAs may argue that such an inseparable association between substance and attributes is admitted by Sri Ramanuja, but ParakAla Yati argues that it is only during the time of union of the quality and the substance that such an inseparability is admitted. 

Siddhānta: 

First of all Madhvas do not talk of association between substance and its attributes. Secondly, how can there be union of the quality and substance when they are inseparable. It is mistake after mistake. Thirdly, assuming that the Madhvas are not aware of the transience of some of the attributes is incorrect, when 

(अयावद्द्रव्यभावि) 

"ayāvaddravyabhāvi" (q) concept is not only presented, but its role is properly theorized. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

In which case, the MAdhvAs themselves do not say blueness and jug is same, leading to the acceptance of the jug being qualified by the quality of Blueness. (Special Note: Only when blueness is with jug do we say its inseparable. Inseparability is not there when jug is not blue. Hence, we cannot say inseparability is the essential nature of the jug, resulting in identity of blue color with the jug)Siddhanta: 

That is precisely what is "ayāvaddravyabhāvi" (some attributes that don't last as long as the object itself like greenness of banana, yellowness of mango, etc.). 

Perhaps meant to say "we cannot say blueness is the essential nature of the jug, resulting...". Of course we cannot. Same way we cannot say yellowness is essential nature of Mango. One of the differences is in the duration of their stay. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

Some MAdhvAs argue that there is both difference and identity, but upon observation, no-one can differentiate between a substance and its qualities, so difference between substance and qualities cannot be made. 

Siddhanta: 

That is identity be made. 

— 

difference between substance and qualities cannot 

They do not last the same, one cannot make jug out of blueness alone - that is the difference. 

So, mādhvas say that there is both difference and identity. They also prove and demonstrate. But, then Visiṣṭādvaitins, intending to attack mādhvas charge out and say that it is wrong and without even their own realization conclude exactly the same "upon their own 

observation" 

Pūrvapaksa: 

However, Sri ParakAla Yati states that this theory is invalid because a proper definition of reality must be non-contradictory and invariable at all times. 

Siddhanta: 

If some one says "Mr. X is tough with bad guys and soft with good guys", no one will argue "How can Mr. X be both tough and soft - he should be non-contradictory and invariable at all times." Two different things in two different contexts. Same way here two different ways 

different in some respect and inseparable in another exactly as per their own observation. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

- 

- 

"Blueness of Jug" and "Blue Colored Jug" are also phrases that differentiate blueness and jug. Hence, it would be incorrect to attempt a definition based on the phrase "blue jug" only. The jug 

appears qualified by "blueness" here. Hence, it is distinct from the quality that qualifies it. 

Siddhānta: 

- 

In case of "pratyakṣasiddha" objects, one coins/builds the phrases based on the facts, truths and thoughts. The converse is not true namely one will not modify or change the facts, truths and thoughts based on the phrases. So in an effort to find the facts, why should one chase the phrases? 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Furthermore, substances are differentiated from one another only basis of their individual qualities. 

Siddhanta: 

Precisely. That is why Viśeșa is useful not only as bhedapratinidhi, when abheda is there, but also as the differentiator with respect to others. The individual qualities of a jug not only helps to know about that jug, but also helps to differentiate from another (say) identical jug, which may have 'same color, 

'same color, same weight, same texture, same shape, etc.'. Both jugs may be blue, but we do not say that blueness of one jug is non-different from blueness of another jug. Each one is its viseṣa. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

If all qualities are identical with their respective substances, there would be no way to differentiate the substances from one another. 

Siddhanta: 

Quite contrarily, that is how we differentiate. Let [Q1] be the set of all the qualities of jug J1 and [22] be the set of all the qualities of jug J2. Even though the jugs J1 and J2 look identical, 

[Q1], which is inseparable from J1 helps you to differentiate J1 from J2. Similarly [Q2], which is inseparable from J2 helps you to differentiate J2 from J1. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Perception does not reveal the svarUpa as such, but only reveals the qualities of a substance, which is different from the qualities of another substance. 

Siddhānta: 

Perception does not reveal the svarūpa For the second part, please see the above. 

— 

this is a vague statement. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

(Special Note: Blue Colored Jug implies difference and Blue Jug implies identity. So, one contradicts the other. Hence, it is wrong to say the blueness and jug are identical taking only the latter definition as authority. The jug is qualified by the blue color, and hence, the two are different from each other.) 

Siddhanta: 

Expressions do not make defintions and definitions do not make conclusions. Conclusions make some of the definitions and definition make some of the expressions. Whether people use the expressions "Blue colored Jug" or "Blue jug", they mean the same thing. It is meaningless to argue that they mean difference in the former and identity in the latter. Authoritativeness r conclusions are not drwan from the expressions, but from the facts. 

There is lot of "charvitacharvanam (f) (Chewing the chewed)". 

That is also like churning the churned. In other words, we see a repetition of pattern in the false accusations that others are making conclusions from the expressions. 

Purvapaksa: 

In addition, there are a number of qualities besides blueness possessed by the jug and it cannot be said that the jug is identical simultaneously with all its qualities. 

Siddhanta: 

Of course not. The jug is blue and smooth. Blueness and smoothness are inseparable from the jug simultaneously. By some chemical process, both blueness and smoothness can be made to go. So, they 

are "ayāvaddravyabhāvi" and so simultaneously, blueness and smoothness are different from the jug. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Furthermore, the qualities themselves are distinct from one another. 

Siddhanta: 

Of course. From the above example, the blueness is different from smoothness. Suppose both the jugs are made of iron. The ironness is 

"yāvaddravyabhāvi". 

So, the ironness is non-different from the jug. The blueness is also different from the jug and so the blueness is also different from ironness. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

A blind man can touch the jug and understand its texture, but he cannot see the color. So, even the quality of color is different from the quality of texture. 

Siddhanta: 

Even a person who can see knows that the color is different from texture. They are "ayāvaddravyabhāvi" and so they are different from elephant and they are also different from one another. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

ParakAla Yati also states that we need to say "The Jug HAS color" and not "The Jug IS color". Hence, MAdhvA"s theory is illogical. 

Siddhanta: 

It is a double whammy. Firstly one can say "The Jug is Blue". Secondly, on one side they are saying that we should not use expressions to judge identity or difference and on another side, they are doing exactly the same. In matters of pratyakṣa, one should not run after the expressions. Only for tatvas that are beyond pratyakṣa, one is obliged to use sabda pramāņa, but for that apauruşeya vedas and all the scriptures that support them are the pramāņa. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

ADIYEN'S COMMENTS: 

Later on, it is said that ParakAla Yati gives a number of Upanisadic statements which suggest a difference between substance and attributes, and which would be rendered absurd if the MAdhvA theory was upheld. Adiyen does not have a copy of the rest of the work, but I can hazard a guess as to what those vAkyAs may be. The Anandavalli praises the kalyAna gunAs of Brahman more than Brahman itself. The Chandogya Up. states in the Dahara Vidya section, 

"There is in this city of Brahman an abode, the small lotus of the heart; within it is a small akasa. Now what exists within that small akasa, that is to be sought after, that is what one should desire to 

understand." 

Sri Ranga Rāmānuja Muni translates akasa as Brahman, and what is within that akasa as the kalyAna gunAs of Brahman. This is mentioned in the next verse as "It contains earth, heaven, fire, air, etc..." meaning, "all objects of enjoyment are these gunAs, contained in this akAsA. So, this in adiyen's opinion, indicates a difference between Brahman and its qualities. Plus, the statement also indicates that the gunAs are so desirable, that they are praised more than Brahman Himself in this context. But this does not denigrate Brahman's 

greatness, as the gunAs are inseparable from Him and constitute His essential nature. 

Siddhānta: 

The biggest blunder they are committing is not even differentiating the jaḍa and cetana in this analysis, which is one of the main reasons for their untold miseries and troubles. They face the apasiddhānta endlessly by presuming that Brahman and His guņa-s are different. 

Further in an eagerness to reject "Madhva theory", an absurd, inconsistent, and untold-in-śruti interpretation of the śruti passage is being passed on and this goes against other śruti pramāṇa-s and Brahmasutras and hence unvedic as well. 

"OM atha yadidamasmin brahmapure daharam puṇḍarī kam veśma | daharo'sminnantarākāśaḥ | tasmin yadantaḥ tadanveṣṭavyam |

छान्दोग्य ८-१-१ 

"A small abode in the form of the Lotus-heart takes refuge in the All-pervading, Ever-auspicious and Ever-full Lord, pervading this body. In this abode resides a small dahara-ākāśa. In that one must seek that - that alone which is to be sought and known." 

See this in the back-drop of the very first Brahmasūtra "OM athāto brahmajijñāsā OM" 

ॐ अथातो ब्रह्मजिज्ञासा ॐ । 

Brahmasūtra - 1-1-1 

- ब्रह्मसूत्र - १-१-१ 

When the teacher tells above words to the disciple, the disciple puts forth a query. 

Then the disciples can ask the teacher as below 

"You told that A small abode in the form of the Lotus-heart takes refuge in the All-pervading, Ever-auspicious and Ever-full Lord, pervading this body. In this abode resides a small dahara-ākāśa. In that one what else can exist? What is there that is to be sought and known?" (perhaps raising a small question as to how can the all- pervading Lord be present in such small place) 

"sa brūyāt yāvānvā ayamākāśastāvāneṣo'ntarhṛdaya akāśa

"For that the teacher replies 

Chandogya 8-1-1 

- छान्दोग्य ८-१-१ 

ākāśa nāmaka parabrahma is present in that small abode in the form of the Lotus-heart. Just as the Lord pervading outside the dahara-ākāśa is infinite by space, time and auspicious qualities, the same Lord, who is present in dahara-ākāśa is also All-infinite. (He is to be sought and and contemplated upon. ) In Him seeking his support reside the mukta (liberated) and amukta 

(non-liberated) abhimāni devatas of svarga, bhūmi, agni, vāyu, Surya, lightning, stars and all others devatas as well. The amuktas are useful for the jiva to do sadhana and so their presence is fruitful. The amuktas are as good as not there for the jivas as they are not useful for the jiva to make the sadhana. Nevertheless, they are all there inside the Lord." 

Where is the mention of the qualities? Where is the mention of difference between Brahman and the qualities? Why all that svakapolakalpita thoughts that too contradicting the basic concept in the scriptures? Why that pure speculation? 

Who cares what their opinion is? What is important is what the śāstras say and what makes sense. They call this external jñāna as 

dharmabhūtajñāna () (hence forth will be referred as DBJ) and the oddities and absurdities that choke their philosophy will be put forth later on. 

— 

If Brahman and His qualities are different, here in dahara-ākāśa, what is the seeker seeking the Lord or His qualities? If He is sought, then the qualities lose significance. If His qualities are sought, He loses His significance. If both are sought, that has to be mentioned explicitly. But there is nothing of that sort. 

If guṇa-s are praised more than Brahman Himself in this context, why is that not mentioned? Praising one more will never denigrate the other. That worry need not be there at all. The question is what are we seeking? 

Further look at this self-contradiction in one breath and one 

sentence 

— 

"the gunAs are inseparable from Him and constitute His essential nature" 

They talk of inseparability of guṇa-s along with the assumption that they are different and also claim that they constitute His essential nature. If they are different, then they do not constitute His essential nature. One can easily see the self-contradiction. 

Since this is such a messy position, one can see how they have to wriggle, jiggle, and struggle to get out of this mess. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

(EDIT: Some queries were raised about what I meant when I stated, "But this does not denigrate Brahman's greatness, as the gunAs are inseparable from Him and constitute His essential nature". I did not phrase this sentence properly. What I meant is that, glorification of Brahman's attributes, which are inseparable from Brahman, and which arise as a consequence of His essential nature being jñānAnandamayam, ultimately culminates in the glorification of Brahman Himself, and hence, praising the gunAs over Brahman is not a defect. This is explained by Sri Ranga Rāmānuja Muni in the Taittiriya Bhashya. The gunAs are different from His essential nature, inseparably linked to, and arise from His essential nature as well.). 

Siddhanta: 

What a mess! When pushed to corner, what people do is mix up some valid statements with their invalid statements and if anyone questions, then project that they are questioning the valid statements. One must have the ability to separate the wheat from the chaff. 

One must also note that the example of Jadas cannot be used to justify their position in explaining the cetanas. The same kind of rules need not apply for both these. Further for cetanas, a big help comes from the scriptures and a proper logical thinking must be clubbed with that. In matters that are inconceivable, sheer logic cannot be applied. But for matters, which need logic, we must think logically. Otherwise, we will be ending up in self-contradiction only. 

— 

To start with, assuming that the Lord's guṇa-s are different from the Lord is abhyupagama vāda. After assuming that, one will pose the question are they separable from Him or not? They are separable from Him leads to a ridiculous position. And so they conclude that they are inseparable from Him. But the issue is the first step itself. How can one conclude that the Lord's guna-s are different from the Lord? It is against scriptures and against logic. See 

"ahikuṇḍalādhikaraṇa" (c) in Brahmasūtras. 

"OM ubhayavyapadeśāttu ahi kuṇḍalavat OM" 

ॐ उभयव्यपदेशात्तु अहिकुण्डलवत् ॐ 

Brahmasutra

3-2-28 

- ब्रह्मसूत्र - ३-२-२८ 

— 

Scriptures mention Brahman is bliss and Brahman's bliss - both such usages can be there. But both are the same. There is no difference between the two 

like the coil of the snake and snake-coil. There cannot be snake-coil without the snake. That is the closest jaḍa example that can be given. If the bliss and Brahman are different, there is no need for this sūtra. And the sutras before and after set a stage for this concept. 

Visiṣṭādvaita is also wrong in saying that the guṇa-s are different from His essential nature. See the following from Kathopaniṣat. 

yathodakam durge vṛṣṭam parvateṣu vidhāvati | 

— 

evaṁ dharmān pṛthak paśyaṁstānevānuvidhāvati || Kathopaniṣat

"On the mountains, in hard-to-reach peak places, when the rain falls, slides down fast; just like that one, who sees difference between God and His guṇa-s and one guna and another guna of the Lord goes to the nether worlds, flowing down fast." 

Hence one must not see any diference between the Lord and His guņas. The right knowledge that there is no difference between the Lord and His guṇa-s/dharmas will rule out their DBJ concept. 

Now let us reason that out. They are claiming that they are inseparably linked. What links them and Who links them and when the link was made. Does another sentient substance links or non-sentient substance links? Why Should God link to the guṇa-s and before linking, were they lying around somewhere? In jaḍa substances, one can see the inseparability as non-difference like "mango-ness" and mango". One can speak of inseparability in case of non-difference and in case of difference also. The mangoness and mango are non-different and inseparable. The jiva and Paramātma are different and inseparable in one way that jiva cannot exist without Paramatma. Where ever jīva is there Paramātma is there, but we cannot say that wherever Paramātma is there, that particular jīva is also there. 

Now look at the interlacing valid and invalid statements.

and hence, praising the gunAs over Brahman is not a defect. question of praising one over the other arises only after it is established? Why indulge in abhyupagamavAda? 

This is explained by Sri Ranga Rāmānuja Muni in the Taittiriya Bhashya. 

Did he really get into this and explain it as such? 

- 

The 

The gunAs are different from His essential nature, inseparably linked to, and arise from His essential nature as well.) - This is a self- contradiction. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

In addition, Brahman is defined by the qualities of Satyatvam, jñānatvam, Anantatvam, Anandatvam and Amalatvam. 

Siddhanta: 

It is not possible to define Brahman as defining an entity is putting 

a limitation to that. Brahman is beyond any definition. Note - 

yato vāco nivartante aprāpya manasa saha Upanisat -2-4-1 

- 

Taittiriya 

यतो वाचो निवर्तन्ते अप्राप्य मनसा सह 

- तैत्तिरीय उपनिषत् - २-४-१ 

Defining is claiming a complete understanding of some thing. 

Otoh, if one says God has infinite qualities like Satyatvam, jñānatvam, Anantatvam, Anandatvam and Amalatvam. This is like claiming a little understanding. 

Also, one must note the difference between sentient (cetana) and non- sentient (jada). The qualities of sentient and the qualities of non- sentient will be different. No one will say that a stone has jñāna or Ananda. No one will say that so and so jīva is hard, soft, wet, dry, green, yellow or pink, etc. 

In case of qualities of jaḍa, the qualities can be "yāvaddravyabhāvi" 

(a) or "ayāvaddravyabhāvi"(E). But in case of cetana, the qualities are all "yavaddravyabhāvi" only, otherwise, one will be forced to attribute vikāra for cetana. It is quite well-known that during saMsāra avastha, the abhivyakti will not be there. So, for cetanas, the qualities will be non-different from the cetana. For jaḍas, the yāvaddravyabhavi qualities are non-different from the substance and ayāvaddravyabhavi qualities will have bheda and abheda. 

That is why for Brahman, one may say "Brahman is jñāna and Ananda" or "Brahman has jñāna and Ananda". Both are correct. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

If He is identical to these qualities, then there is no way to get a grasp of the nature 

Siddhanta: 

Quite contrarily, if identical then only one can get grasp. If not identical, one should ask oneself - Is the jñāna of Brahman sentient or non-sentient? If it is sentient, who is that sentient? If it is non-sentient, how can a sentient entity have a jaḍa as its quality? 

Let us take one guna, svarupajñāna of the Lord for example. If He is different, then it must be external to the Lord. Since they are different, is He inside the jñāna or Is this external jñāna of the Lord inside Him ? In either case, He is dependent on jaḍa jñāna. Same way, He will be dependent on his all other guṇa-s as well. This will be a huge flaw in Him. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

— 

MAdhvAs, on the basis of Visesa, argue that the body of SrimanNarayana is His svarUpa as well, and no difference between rupam and svarUpam exists. 

Siddhanta: 

The viseṣas is a process of explaining. The basis is śāstras and Brahmasutras. Also the reasoning will also lead to that only. Please see ahikuṇḍalādhikaraṇa. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

The SubhAsrayam chapter of Viṣṇu PurAnA is useful in this regard to differentiate Brahman and its body, refuting the MAdhvA conception. 

Siddhanta: 

That is an empty claim. There is nothing that differentiates Brahman and its body. That is attributing flaws to the Brahman. And also that goes against the scriptures, as will be shown later on. 

Further, the quotes from Vişņu purāņa that they use go against their own claims. 

viṣṇoḥ sakāśādudbhūtaṁ jagat-tatraiva ca sthitam stithisamyamakartā'sau jagato'sya jagacca saḥ 

विष्णोः सकाशादुद्भूतम् जगत्-तत्रैव च स्थितम्। 

स्तिथिसंयमकर्ताऽसौ जगतोऽस्य जगच्च सः ॥ 

where 'jagat cha saḥ'( :) directly equates Vişņu with the world. 

Isn't that the self-destructive position of Visiṣṭādvaita? 

Their position - 

P1. As stated, Viṣṇu purāņa differentiates Brahman and its body. 

P2. They also claim that jagat is His body. 

(Vi Pu 1.1.35) 

वि पु १-१-३५ 

P3. The above quote directly equates Visņu with the world, which is His body!! 

Since Visiṣṭādvaita takes all these literally, Brahman is equated with His body and also differentiated from His body. One can see an obvious self-contradiction. 

Otoh, if they understand the following basic concept and do not take things literally, they will be free from these terrible difficulties. 

There are three ways an identity or non-difference statement can be given. 

I-1. Two sentient beings 

I-2. Two non-sentient beings 

I-3. One sentient and one non-sentient being 

In case of I1, either one sentient being is under the full control of another sentient being or one sentient being is compared to another sentient being in some respects, but not all. 

When the Lord is equated to another deity like Brahma, Rudra, Vāyu, Indra, et al, there are atleast three ways, one can undrestand that. 

I-la. The Lord is also known by those names and those names describe the Lord and etymologically they may have different roots. Or even if the roots are the same, in case of the Lord, the referred qualities bear full potency and in case of the others, they don't. 

I-1b. The Lord is present with those names inside them. 

I-1c. The Lord fully controls them bearing the very same names. 

One may see some overlapping in the above three sub-aspects. 

Then there are expressions like paramam samyamupaiti. Here the comparison is in some respects only, but not all. Being devoid of sorrow, having reached one's own Fullness (which again varies based on the inherent capacity), being without a gross body, etc are some of the respects, which are common to the Lord and the mukta jīvas. Hence the similarity is mentioned, which may sound like equality, but there is enough information that tells us what it is. 

We say "The king is a lion in the battlefield". Here the comparison is in the ferociousness, but not in all the qualities. One would not expect the king to walk on his fours. 

In case of I-2, when we hear expressions like "The king's sword is Vajrayudha only", we know that the king's sword is like Vajrayudha. 

If we use "like", it is "Upamālankāra"(34HI♡§R ). 

If we use identity itself, it is "Rūpakālankāra"(GER). 

In case of 1-3, it will be like this. If cetana C is in control of a jaḍa J, we tend to use expressions that equate C and J. Suppose a person X is fully in charge of an organization G, we may say X is G. What we mean is X fully controls G. 

The followng verses are from Viṣṇupurāṇa. 

paramārthasthvamevaiko nānyo asti jagatapateḥ tavaiṣā mahimā yena vyāptametaccarācaraṁ |

परमार्थस्त्वमेवैको नान्योऽस्ति जगतः पते।

वि पु१-४-३८ 

"You alone are Paramartha. Oh, Lord of the universe, there is no one else, who is Paramartha. Your this mahima or glory pervades this entire universe of moving and non-moving entities." 

There is no indication that the universe is described as His body. In fact the two attributes - Lord of the universe and One who pervades this entire universe of moving and non-moving entities indicate that the Universe is not described as His body.

which they mistake as an identity connecting Brahman, selves and jagat. 

"All this is One. What ever exists here, every tiny bit is that Achyuta. Nothing is more important than that. I am Him. You are that. All of this is Atmasvarupa. Give up the illusory difference." 

Note the context and the meaing becomes very clear. 

The above verse means "He alone is the most important one in all things that exist. He is present in everything nad controls everything. He is called Achyuta as He is Indiminishable and undisplaceable. Nothing other than Him is independent and nothing is more important than Him. He is inside me and controls me and He is inside you and controls you. Thus He is Atma meaning Inner controller of all this. Stop seeing difference in His various forms. The illusory thinking that something other than Him can b independent has to be forsaken.". 

This is exactly like the Bhagavadgita verse -

is elaborated by statements like the above Gita verse and the above Viṣṇupurāṇa

(विष्णुपुराण) 

In the above Viṣṇupurāṇa(), "sarvatra samabuddhi" 

samabuddhi"(Hf) (Equality of Lord's forms in all objects) is another concept to be noted. Those who have such right knowledge will head towards mokṣa, by forsaking anyathārūpa and obtaining nijarupa, thru the grace of the Lord. 

All these extoll the Lord with no trace of śarīra śarīri bhāva (शरीर शरीरि भाव ) .

मत्तः सर्वमहम् सर्वम् मयि सर्वम् सनातने ॥

The apparent meaning is 

"Due to the all-pervasiveness of the endless one, I exist as that only, Everything springs from me. I am every thing. Every thing is in me, the ancient one." 

Even Visiṣṭādvaita will not go with the apparent meaning. This is like Advaita only and in this prayer of Prahlada, the prior and latter verses and the context clearly indicate that it is not so. The real, correct and beautiful meaning is this. 

"Due to the Omnipresence of the Eternal one, He alone can exist as 'aham' sabdavācya. All this springs from Him, created by Him. He alone is the indweller and controller of every thing. He exists before deluge, during deluge and after deluge (hence known as sanātana) and everything resides in Him, seeking His support. In other words they take refuge in Him." 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

There are some articles in various Sri Vaishnava sites on how Brahman is different from its body and kalyAna gunAs. Please search them out if you are interested. 

Siddhanta: 

If wishes were to become horses, the beggars would ride. Brahman is different from various objects and He is different from the universe, but none of these are His body. At the same time, He is non-different from His kalyāņa gunās. Otherwise what is God without those auspicious qualities? He need to be dependent on those. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

MAdhvAs have refuted archa avatara on the basis of their own assumptions that Brahman and its body are identical. 

Siddhanta: 

There are no assumptions. That is śāstra-siddha. 

Look what Sri Krishna says in Gita 

avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanumāśritam | paraṁ bhāvamajānanto mama bhūtamaheśvaram || 

अवजानन्ति माम् मूढा मानुषीम् तनुमाश्रितम् । 

परम् भावमजानन्तो मम भूतमहेश्वरम् ॥ 

Gītā 9-11 

गीता ९-११ 

"The ignorant, not knowing my form correctly and not knowing that I am the embodiment of knowledge, bliss and full of attributes, disregard me thinking that like humans, I also acquire a body." 

The śruti vākya says 

pūrṇamadaḥ pūrṇamidam pūrṇātpūrṇamudacyate | pūrṇasya pūrṇamādāya pūrṇamevāvaśiṣyate || 

पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदम् पूर्णात्पूर्णमुदच्यते । 

पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते॥ 

"The Lord is all Full and all-infinite in His mūlarūpa (not needing a physical body) and in all His incarnations also He is infinite and Full of all auspicious attributes (not needing any physical body)." 

Taittiriya Upaniṣat says 

— 

"satyam jñānam anantam brahmā"(सत्यम् ज्ञानम् अनन्तम् ब्रह्मा) 

"The Lord is an embodiment of satya, jñāna and He is limitless". 

Thus His having a body or confined by a body is meaningless. 

More explanation and reasons for rejecting their idea of Archāvatara can be found further down. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

So, they ask, "How can you say the deity in temples is the Lord Himself, its equating matter with IsvarA". What they have failed to understand is that we differentiate between the Lord and His body. 

Siddhānta: 

From all the above śāstra pramāṇa-s, the Lord is to be taken as non- different from His body. The Visiṣṭādvaitins claim that the icon is actually the avatāra of the Lord and hence the icon is His body. Based on the above pramāṇa-s, when a question is put as to how can the jaḍa icon be equated to the Lord sinc e He is same as His body, they counter it by saying that they differentiate between the Lord and His body and so they are not equating the jaḍa icon with the Lord. That is like going from frying pan to fire. Now they have to answer all the above objections and also the objections that ensue 

(given further down). 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The body is Suddha Sattvam, and such a Tattvam is not comprehended by MAdhvAs. The Kaushitaki Upanishad mentions Sri Vaikunta as a real place with trees, palaces, etc. These are made of suddha sattvam. Suddha Sattvam is also matter, but it is non-material matter, not prakrtic. 

Siddhanta: 

It is complete misconception on their part that either Madhvas have no concept of suddha satva or they do not agree that suddha satva exists or they have no comprehension of suddha satva. In several places such śuddha satva in vaikuṇṭha has been extensively referred. 

It is described as "aprākṛtika" and "divya". 

The issue is not acceptance of such a substance. The issue here is whether the vigraha (icon) is made of suddha satva. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

Sri Pillai LokAchAryA has mentioned that regarding the thirumeni of the Lord in temples as prakrtic is a great sin. 

Siddhanta: 

Thinking that the God has a body, be it suddha satva, is much greater sin. 

There is no scope for "svakapolakalpita" thoughts. Further look at the following problems they face. If vigraha is Lord's body, then 

Stagel: They faced the issue that Paramātma is jaḍa since there is no difference between Lord and His body. 

To get around that problem, they claimed that the Lord and His body are different and still the vigraha is His body. 

Stage2: Then they faced the issue that the vigraha, which is pancha bhūtatmaka prākṛtika jaḍa is His body. 

That is not acceptable and to get around that problem, they claimed that the vigraha is śuddha satva. Now this is worse, as they have to answer all the pramāṇa-s that declare that the God is non-different from His body and also they face the jaḍa being the body of the Lord. 

Stage3: Now they face the issue that the vigraha is still jaḍa (only relief that they get is that it is not prākṛtika). It is like saying "I dont want to be hit by a metal rod, but I want to be hit by a golden rod". 

Now they have to answer all the pramāņa-s that declare that the God is non-different from His body and still answer how Lord can have a jaḍa body (a special jaḍa, surely). And this is still worse, because now they face the following issues as well. 

1. The śuddha satva is claimed to be in the liberated world (mokṣa only). Surely the Lord is Omnipotent and so He can bring śuddha satva into this world as well. But then there have to be pramāṇa-s, which declare that. It cannot be svakapolakalpita. 

2. Did the vigraha become śuddha satva before the sculptor made the icon or after? If it is śuddha satva all the time, how could the sculptor make a vigraha by chiseling it? How was he able to sit on that vigarha while working on it? If it became śuddha satva later on, 

how can the prakṛitik vigraha get transformed into aprākṛtik śuddha 

satva? 

3. Let us not even ask that question. Let us assume by some hook or crook, it became śuddha satva. Then we came across the instances, where muslims and other vandals destroyed the vigrahas. How were they able to destroy the suddha satva vigrahas? 

4. śuddha satva is aprākṛtik and so no one should be able to see it. Let us assume that the Lord is so gracious that He allowed his devotees to see that. But then how could the vandals see it? 

5. Are the vigrahas of Viṣṇu alone are śuddha satva or are the vigrahas of other deities also śuddha satva? 

6. After the destruction did the vigrahas remain as śuddha satva or change to non-śuddha-satva? Either way it is an issue. 

7. How come the Lord, with suddha satva body does not even move around. Even the ordinary jīvas like all kinds of animals, humans and birds are able to move around with prākṛtik bodies, but the Lord with aprākṛtik body does not move around?

8. Mahāvarāhapurāṇa says the following 

anityatvam dehahāniḥ duḥkhaprāptirapūrṇatā | nāśaścaturvidhaḥ proktaḥ tadabhāvo hareḥ sadā | tadanyeṣāṁ tu sarveṣāṁ nāśāḥ kecidbhavanti hi || 

अनित्यत्वम् देहहानिः दुःखप्राप्तिरपूर्णता । 

Mahāvarāhapurāṇa 

नाशश्चतुर्विधः प्रोक्तः तदभावो हरेः सदा। 

तदन्येषाम् तु सर्वेषाम् नाशाः केचिद्भवन्ति हि ॥ 

महावराहपुराण 

"Destruction of self, Destruction of body, acqusition of sorrow, incompleteness are four kinds of destruction. Sri Hari does not have any of these. All the others have some kind of destruction." 

With the occasional destruction of the vigrahas, Sri Hari is now affected with one kind of destruction, namely destruction of body!! 

9. What is worse, the ordinary jīva after going to mokṣa, eventually gets free from bodily-destruction. However Sri Hari is eternally afflicted by this kind of bodily destruction. Thus in this aspect Sri Hari worse off than ordinary jiva!! 

10. Only Mula vigrahas in the temples are avatāras of the Lord or utsava vigrahas also avatāras of the Lord? Are both kinds made of śuddha sattva or only the Mula vigrahas are made of suddha sattva? What about the vigrahas that the devotees keep in their pūjā rooms? If people say "No, the vigrahas in the homes of the devotees are not 

avatāras of the Lord and so not śuddha satva", then they can contend that by protesting "regarding the thirumeni of the Lord in my pUja room as prakritic is a great sin." 

- 

11. Why is the vigraha śuddha satvam their argument is that it is so because the vigraha is śarIra of the Brahman and His śarIra has to be śuddha satvam. If that is their argument, they argue that this entire universe is sarIra of Brahman. So, this entire universe must be śuddha satva according to them. 

12. If the śarIra of Brahman has to be suddha satva, then as per them the jiva is sarIra of Brahman and so the jīva must be suddha satva, meaning the jiva must be jada according to them. 

They have to face so many issues. These expose their loose unsupported statements? 

Apart from lack of any pramāņa (except their own works), the enormous inconsistencies they face just debunk their statements of this kind. 

Remember one thing. In spite of the insignificant inert object, the Gracious God's grandeur graces that vigraha granting it the power to grant the mokṣa itself. That is what is called sannidhāna and the Lord gives and takes it out as per His will. 

So, instilling the imaginative fear in the minds of devotees by telling 'if one regards the icon/vigraha as non-incarnation of the Lord, it is a great sin', itself is a great sin as that is tantamount to attributing flaws to the Lord. 

Purvapakṣa: 

The difference between a substance and its qualities does not regress to infinity because Sri Rāmānuja has stated that difference is an inherent nature of 

an attribute itself. 

Siddhanta: 

Sure. That is what is called viseṣa. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

Vijayindra ParAjayA

Refutation of Ananda TAratamya 

MAdhvas believe that having entered into the supreme nature of Brahman, the liberated AtmA enjoys its bliss through themselves, as "mere attempts of intelligence". 

Siddhanta: 

That is wrong understanding. Madhvas believe "svatantram asvatantram cha dvividham tatvamiṣyate | svatantro bhagavan viṣṇuḥ"(स्वतन्त्रम् अस्वतन्त्रम् च द्विविधम् तत्वमिष्यते। स्वतन्त्रो भगवान् विष्णुः) 

Only Viṣṇu is independent. The liberated ātma enjoys its bliss through Bhagavan Viṣṇu, but as per its own yogyata only. There is no question of enjoying themselves. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Hence, they attempt to refute Vishishtadvaita as follows: The MuktAs do not have all the bliss that the Lord has. Each individual Self gets AnandA based on its own capacities. The MAdhvA provides the following example: just as by performing different sacrifices, different fruits are obtained, similarly, the JivAs, by performing different sAdhanAs, attain different types of pleasures in mokṣa. If Sri Rāmānuja admits Prapatti as an easier alternative to Bhakti, then the individuals attaining mokṣa by Bhakti would have greater anandA as compared to prapannas. 

Siddhānta: 

It is very important to understand that be it Bhakti or Prapatti, they are all tools for jñāna. The mokṣa comes only thru jñāna. The true jñāna will lead to proper bhakti and prapatti, etc. There is no objection to Bhakti or Prapatti, etc. The problem is if one claims that there is no need for jñāna; prapatti alone is sufficient to get mokṣa, that is objected to. 

"nanyaḥ panthā ayanāya vidyate |" (नान्यः पन्था अयनाय विद्यते । ) 

"na hi jñānena sadrśam pavitramiha vidyate | " ( न हि ज्ञानेन सदृशम् पवित्रमिह विद्यते । ) 

(ब्रह्मविदाप्नोति परम्।) 

"brahmavidāpnoti param"(qifa T41) 

"jñānenaiva param padam | " (ज्ञानेनैव परम् पदम्।) 

So Bhakti or Prapatti without jñāna will not lead to mokṣa. 

And every body does not have same amount of jñāna. 

jñānatāratamya (ज्ञानतारतम्य) is indicative of yogyatātāratamya ( योग्यतातारतम्य ) . 

jñānatāratamya leads to bhaktitäratamya (HR), which in turn leads to 

Anandatāratamya (आनन्दतारतम्य ) . 

"tadbhaktitāratamyena tāratamyam vimuktigam | " (तद्भक्तितारतम्येन तारतम्यम् विमुक्तिगम्। ) 

No other way out. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

MAdhvAs further assert that if the Vishishtadvaita view of equal AnandA is followed, then it means the JivA has equal status to Brahman. This is against the ShAstrAs. 

Siddhanta: 

Ambiguity and onfusion can corrode correct knowledge. Please consider the following 

Equal Ananda of muktas compared to God. Jiva has equal status to Brahman. 

S1 

S2 

If S1 is followed, then it means that S2 is true. Madhvas assert S3. 

— 

S3 

S4 

This is against śāstras. 

- S5 

Let us analyze the above claim of Visiṣṭādvaita. 

What is meant by S2? 

What does "This" in S5 refer to? If "This" refers to S2, then what is S2? 

Where is the support for this kind of assertion? 

What is the issue Visiṣṭādvaita is facing? If it does not agree to S2 and it has problem with S3, then it is not the question of śāstra here, but it is a question of inference here. 

Further Madhvas need neither S2 nor S3 to reject S1. There is plenty of scope to reject S1 by itself using scriptural support. 

If by “status”, “status of bliss” is meant, then S1 and S2 become synonymous and S3 becomes trivially true. There is no need for S4 at all. Madhvas reject S1 without going for S2, S3 or S4. 

If by "status", "position or power" is meant, even then Madhvas reject S1 without going for S2, S3 or S4. There is no need for S2, S3 and S4 to reject S1. 

COMMENT: Are the purvapaxins just doing anuvada of the Dvaita side? 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Furthermore, how can the JivA have equal AnandA with Sri Hari when the Brahma SutrAs say it does not possess some powers such as creation, etc. which Sri Hari possesses? 

Siddhanta: 

Again a wrong vyapti. It is not - 

Jiva does not possess powers such as creation, etc. ==> Hence jīva cannot have equal Ananda. 

The reasons for jīva not having equal ananda arises from scriptures itself. Also that is the most logical thing. 

Not only that, creation, maintenance, destruction, control, giving knowledge, ignorance, bondage, liberation are additional tasks. 

So, the Lord does all this and gets certain Ananda. Then the mukta jiva does not do any of these, but still gets same Ananda as Brahman. This is like saying one person toils day and night and gets a salary of million dollars. Another one does not do anything, but still gets a million dollars. Then the situation of the latter is much better 

than the former. Is it not? That is weird too. 

COMMENT: Are the purvapaxins just doing anuvada of the Dvaita side? 

Pūrvapaksa: 

The PramAnA for the gradation in mokşa for MAdhvAs is the Anandavalli of the Taittiriya Up., which measures the bliss enjoyed by manushyAs, GandharvAs, DevAs, etc. 

Siddhānta: 

And also Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣat. This will be discussed in detail later 

on. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

ParakAla Yati refutes this view. Based on their Seshatva SvarUpa, the jiva does not enjoy its own bliss. It enjoys the bliss of Brahman. The state of mokṣa is not Self-Realisation (called Kaivalya ) but it's the realization of Bhagavad SvarUpa. 

Siddhānta: 

That goes against the following pramāņa-s. 

OM sampadyavihāya svena śabdāt OM 

1 

ॐ सम्पद्याविहाय स्वेन शब्दात् ॐ 

Brahmasūtra 4-4- 

ब्रह्मसूत्र ४-४-१ 

Having reached Parabrahman, the jñāni, without leaving Him (the Lord), by His own inherent self, enjoys the bliss - thus proclaim the śrutis.

मुक्तिर्हित्वा अन्यथा रूपम् स्वरूपेन व्यवस्थितिः। 

Bhāgavata 2-10-6 

भागवत २ - १०-६ 

The mukti is nothing but forsaking what is not inherent and enjoying one's own inherent nature (without forsaking the Lord).

छान्दोग्य - ८-१२-२ 

"Just like the four Vayu, Brahma, Bhārati and Sarasvati, the jīva forsakes his body by the grace of the Lord, reaches the Paramjyoti Paramātma and attains svarūpAnanda āvirbhāva". 

Note that when it is said that the jīva enjoys its own inherent bliss, even that svarūpa ānanda āvirbhāva happens only from the grace of the Lord. Kaivalya or Self-realization is "Realization of the Supreme self". The mukta jīva revels in the darśana ānanda of the Supreme Lord. That itself is inherent to the mukta jīva. 

Further there is heavy confusion in the usage of the expression 

"realization". 

Realize can mean "being aware of" or "comprehend". 

It can also mean "acquire" or "attain". 

The jiva can comprehend the Lord to the extent of its ability. But the jiva can not have the entire bliss of the Lord. The jiva cannot also comprehend the Lord completely (yato vaacho nivartante aprāpya manasā saha) this is applicable in mokşa also. If the jīva cannot comprehend the Lord fully, then where is the question of having the same bliss as the Lord? 

— 

They should have atleast read the commentary of their own Acharya. While commenting on the verse 15-16 of Gita, Sri Rāmānuja says 

akṣaraśabdanirdiṣṭaḥ kūṭasthaḥ acitsamsargaviyuktaḥ svena rūpeņa avasthito muktātmā | 

Rāmānujabhāṣya for Gītā 15- 

16 

अक्षरशब्दनिर्दिष्टः कूटस्थः अचित्संसर्गवियुक्तः स्वेन रूपेण अवस्थितो मुक्तात्मा । 

रामानुजभाष्य - गीता १५-१६ 

"The liberated soul, termed as akṣara, is also termed as kūṭastha, for having no contact with insentient, remains in its own form. (enjoying his own bliss, even though controlled by Paramātma)." 

1 

The jiva enjoys the bliss thru the Lord the bimba-pratibimba bhāva continues even in mokṣa. The jiva does not enjoy the bliss of the Lord. One must be careful in using proper expression. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

ParakAla Yati states that the Taittiriya Upanishad refers to BaddhAs with difference in dharma bhūta jñānA while declaring their relative anandA. Therefore, the MAdhvA theory that such differences in AnandA pertain to mokşa is wrong. 

Siddhanta: 

Both Taittiriya Upanișat and Chandogya Upaniṣat clearly say that it pertains to mokṣa only. Even simple common sense and logical thinking will tell that it can only be in mokşa. It cannot refer to baddhas. It will be explained later on in detail. The kind of DBJ (dharma buta jnana) spoken of is non-existent, anti-scriptural and irrational and so cannot be supported and is to rejected completly. 

The Vrittijñāna that is pertinent to saMsāra is quite acceptable, but that will be cast off at the time of liberation. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Since the dharma bhūta jñānA is expanded infinitely for all Jivas in mokṣa, there is equal cognition of Brahman"s kalyAna gunAs for all, and hence, equal enjoyment, implying also that all JivAs are identical in SvarUpA. 

Siddhanta: 

To start with there is no scriptural statement that supports "dharma- bhūta-jñāna" (DBJ). Further there is no scriptural statement that speaks of its expansion. Much less is the scope for "infinite expansion". There is no end to the assumptions. Next assumption is that a mukta jīva gets the cognition of Brahman's kalyāņa guṇa-s completely (as much as Brahman Himself or else there is no scope for ānanda samya). Next assumption is that all the mukta jīvas get equal cognition of Brahman's kalyāņa guna-s implying all get full cognition of all the kalyana guṇa-s of the Lord. Next assumption is that all the mukta jīvas get equal enjoyment. Next assumption is that this enjoyment of all the jivas equals that of Brahman Himself. 

For accomplishing this impossible thing, a non-existent dhama bhūta jñāna is used. It is supposed to continue into mokṣa to accomplish the above impossible things. This is akin to bringing lot of hare's horns, then paint them with different colors and then using them to build the machines that make all the humans equally strong. 

The continuation of DBJ into mokṣa is not only unsupported, but it goes against scriptures. "na pretya samjñā asti" (Nothing other than svarūpajñāna, is carried to mokşa). Later on this concept of DBJ will be refuted completely. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

To quote from the Vijayindra ParAjayA, 

"The differences in bliss experienced by the said entities (manushya, gandharva, deva, etc.) in the Anandavalli are primarily due to expansions and contractions of their intelligence (dharma bhūta jñānA), based on karma and do not pertain to the state of mokşa." 

Siddhanta: 

A non-existent, anti-scriptural and irrational concept of 

DBJ is used in an irrational, anti-scriptural and inconsistent way 

(expansions and contractions of DBJ, leading to variations of bliss in saMsāra, but equality of bliss in mokṣa) to force-fit a ridiculous and anti-scriptural concept of ananda-sāmya in mokṣa, by ignoring the explicitly stated expressions in scriptures that emphatically declare that the discussion is for muktas only. 

In Taittiriya Upanisat ( तैत्तिरीय उपनिषत्) - 

te ye sataṁ mānuṣā ānandāḥ | sa eko manuṣyagandharvāṇāmānandaḥ | śrotriyasya cākāmahatasya ||

If one sees the prior "rk", it is obvious that the stage is set to describe the gradation of bliss in liberation. It is said earlier on "atha_so.abhayam gato bhavati |" (अथ सोऽभयम् गतो भवति । ) ( Now he acquires 

a kind of fearless state and reaches the fearless Lord). If there is still confusion in the minds of the readers, that is expelled in the above "rk". 

One hundred bliss units of Mukta chakravartis = one bliss unit of mukta Manuşya Gandharvas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravaṇa phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become aptakāmas). 

One hundred bliss units of Mukta Manuşya Gandharvas = one bliss unit 

of mukta Deva Gandharvas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravana phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become aptakāmas). 

One hundred bliss units of Mukta Deva Gandharvas = one bliss unit of mukta pitṛ devatas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravana phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become aptakāmas). 

One hundred bliss units of Mukta pitṛ devatas = one bliss unit of mukta ajānaja devatas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravaṇa phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become aptakāmas). 

= 

One hundred bliss units of Mukta ajānaja devatas one bliss unit of mukta karmaja devatas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravaṇa phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become aptakāmas). 

and then it continues from Mukta Karmaja devatas to Mukta devatas, etc. upto Chaturmukha Brahma. 

Note that in each case, the two words "śrotriyasya" and "akāmahatasya" are repeated tirelessly to avoid any confusion and to emphasize that this is "ānanda mīmāMsa of mukta jīvas only, not amukta jīvas. 

A similar account is given in Brhadāranyakopanişat (बृहदारण्यकोपनिषत् ) 

sa yo manuṣyāṇām rāddhaḥ samṛddho bhavatyanyeṣāmadhipatiḥ sarvairmanuş yakairbhogaiḥ sampannatamaḥ sa manuṣyāṇāṁ parama ānandaḥ |

अथैष एव परम आनन्द एष ब्रह्मलोकः सम्राडिति होवाच याज्ञवल्क्यः। 

Note in the above, rāddha is applicable to Muktas only. 

The term "śrotriya" means one who obtained the full fruit of veda adhyayana. 

This can truly apply to muktas only. 

= 

avrjina 

akāmahata 

one who devoid of sorrow 

= 

āpta kāmas (whose desire never remains unfulfilled). 

These are applicable to muktas only. 

Did they really miss these terms? 

Of course, some may start arguing "Oh Sanskrit is such a flexible language; we can interpret these terms differently". The important thing is that one should go for such alternate interpretations if the rūḍhyartha or prasiddha artha gives problems. 

Also the alternate interpretation should not lead to other difficulties. To reject a problem-less rūḍhyartha and to resort to an implausible explanation is not wise at all. Such an approach can only happen for those with pūrvāgraha. 

- 

Even if this wish be granted for just a minute to see if that helps them in any way. If the above only applies to amukta/baddha jivas, then the very next question that comes to our mind is - "OK, this account is for all amukta jīvas why should the śrutis come and tell us what happens in amukta state, which can be gauged much more easily than in mukta state? Ok, let us say that Vedas wanted to express this amukta position any way. Then right after that to remove all the confusion, the śruti vākyas can say one most important and most required statement "...but in mukti, the levels of ānanda of all the mukta jīvas are equal and equal to that of the Brahman.". 

No such statement can be seen, not right after those statements and nowhere in śrutis. Truly their position is untenable. 

Another big problem with that assumption that the śruti vākya is saying ānanda tāratamya for amuktas is this. The joy for amuktas is ever-fluctuating and so what point of time is that tāratamya addressing? After Vritrāsura vadha, Indra was highly depressed. At that point of time, some other insignificant jīva may be having a great joy. So, the joy of that insignificant jiva is higher than Indra at that point of time. So, how will that śruti statement apply? It does not make any sense if that statement speaks of a situation, where there is lot of fluctuation. It makes lot of sense when that speaks of a situation where a "level of constancy" is reached. That happens only in mokṣa. If the gradation is for muktas, there is absolutely no difficulty. 

And the Brahman has to do all the activities and yet the mukta jīvas, who dont do any thing will reap the same bliss of the Lord, who does all the work. It is not ānanda samya, but ānandavaiṣamya. The Brahman is much worse off than all the mukta jīvas. What is worse, according to Visiṣṭādvaita, even those who hate the Lord all the time obtain mukti only. So, even they get the same ananda as the Brahman. The ānanda or bliss experienced by their own Acharya after he goes to mukti is same as the ananda reaped by "Kalipuruşa" and the jīva in the grass and in the ant after they go to mokṣa. 

Ananda Samya is nothing but a disastrous position. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

{Special Note: MAdhvA recognizes only the knower and the object of knowledge. 

Siddhanta: 

Completely wrong. Can they show any statement that supports their position. Do they really claim that Madhvācārya knows only jñātṛ and jñeya, but has no awareness of jñāna? I don't know what they are trying to say? 

Pūrvapaksa: 

But Sri Ramanuja recognizes 3 entities knower, the attribute 'to know' and the object of knowledge'. 

Siddhānta: 

Multiple problems in their approach. This kind of arguments are called "run-away arguments or wandering arguments or strawmanarguments". They make claims that cannot be justified. Secondly even those claims do not come to their rescue as will be proved later on. Just because there are jñātṛ, jñeya and jñāna, that will not help in claiming DBJ. If they are referring to 'indriya janya or antaḥkaraṇastha vṛtti jñāna", then such is extensively mentioned and held in Madhva Siddhānta. But that Vritti jñāna goes away when one goes to mokṣa, as the jaḍa indriyas are gone. Svarupajñāna alone remains. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

Example: A gem possesses innate radiance. This is svarUpa jñānA. But it also has a radiance that spreads from it, illuminating other objects. This is called dharma bhūta jñānA. When the gem is covered by dust, the spread of radiance will be less, but its innate radiance is intact. 

Siddhanta: 

Let us eliminate confusion here. The diamond has the following property. All these are inherent to it. 

It has innate radiance. This innate radiance itself has the following properties 

1. It reacts to external light. The brighter the external light, the greater its dazzling, reflecting the light and shining forth. 

2. Its capacity to reflect the light depends on its own capacity and also the non-interference another substance like mud, dust or a dark paper wrap, etc. 

3. In pitch dark, where not even dim light is there, not even ultraviolet light or the like there, it has not got anything to reflect. 

4. Even after the removal of dust, etc, there is no scope for infinite light emanating from the gem. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Similarly, a JivA (analogous to gem) under karmA (analogous to dust), has less dharma bhūta jñānA (analogous to spreading radiance), but its svarUpa jñānA (innate radiance) is intact. In the state of mokṣa, karma is cleansed just like dust is removed from a gem, and all jivAs have their dharma bhuta jñānA expanded infinitely. 

Siddhanta: 

The light of this gem will not exceed the light of the Sun. (note 

that even the light of the Sun is not infinite and it relies on the Lord) 

yadādityagataṁ tejo jagadbhāsayate'khilam | yaccandramasi yaccāgnau tattejo viddhi māmakam || 

यदादित्यगतम् तेजो जगद्भासयतेऽखिलम्। 

Gitā 15-12 

यच्चन्द्रमसि यच्चाग्नौ तत्तेजो विद्धि मामकम्॥ 

गीता १५-१२ 

"The shining power in the Sun that illuminates the world, the shining power in moon and in fire are all mine" so says the Lord. 

— 

That being the case, why this wild conjecture of infinite expansion? 

Where does this DBJ come from? Is that inherent to jīva or not? Where is its locus? Does it continue into mukti state? Why should it expand infinitely? If it is not inherent to jīva, what stops its being lost? If that has such an extra-ordinary capacity to make each jīva, even as insignificant as a bacteria to have infinite bliss in mokṣa, then a source of such tall and big claim must not only find an explicit place in scriptures, but must have been repeated and emphasized many places as that is a very critical element, since it is removing the flaw of apūrṇata in the jivas and bringing it in par with Brahman Himself. 

Each gem reflects different amount of light. Each luminous object has its own capacity. The moon reflects a lot of light. Each lamp has different light. The light bulbs have varying capacity. The sun's light exceeds that of all these. God's lustre is infinitely more than that. It does not even make sense to compare the glow of any jīva with that of the Lord. Even after going to mokṣa, not only the jiva is dependent on the Lord, the jiva is amazed seeing the brightness of the Lord. The mukta jīvas being equal to Brahman is unsupported. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

This is supported by Upanishadic vAkyAs like Svayam PrakAsatvam of AtmA, ie, AtmA reveals itself by itself (svarUpa) and illumines other objects (dharma bhūta jñānA. 

Siddhanta: 

If jīva has svayam prakāśatva, that is fine. If there is a claim that jīva is jñāna ānāndātmaka, that is accepted. If there is svarupa ānanda abhivyakti in mokṣa, that is fine. Where is the usage of DBJ in Upaniṣats? What other equivalent word is used? If such DBJ makes jiva become equal to Brahman, there must have been several statements explaining that, since that is an extra-ordinary claim. Where are those bold statements? 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Also, 'He who knows Brahman becomes Brahman'. Here, JivA is called Brahman because of its great dharma bhūta jñānA, expanded on knowing ParamAtmA. 'Brahman' means that which grows great, and the jivA's jñānA is great.} 

Siddhanta: 

If some one says that a person who joins Micrsoft becomes a micrsoft person, it is pretty obvious that every employee will not become the "Microsoft company" itself or become equal to the "microsoft company". That being the case, where is the question of a jīva that reaches Brahman (in mokşa) become Brahman Himself or become equal to Brahman? One must arrive at the meaning based on the context. 

The continuation of DBJ into mokṣa is not only unsupported, but it 

goes against scriptures. "na pretya samjñā asti"(+ŞI BIÊA) (Nothing other than svarūpajñāna, is carried to mokṣa).

The meaning hidden there has to be understood properly. While Advaitins interpreted this to mean that jiva becomes Brahman, Visiṣṭādvaitins interpreted that to mean that jīva becomes equal to 

Brahman.

One can get proper meaning from skaṁdapurāņa () words (as quoted by Acharya). Note that one does not become Brahman nor become equal to Brahman.

"One who knows Parabrahma, becomes full of jñāna ānanda, etc as per one's own yogyata. He cannot acquire even a tiny bit more than his own yogyata. Then where is the question of his acquiring Sri Hari's guṇa-s? Jivas acquiring Brahmatva or Brmhitatva means as per their yogyata, they become full; it does not mean that they become paramātma or equal to Paramātma. Paramātma is always solely all- independent. How can the ever-dependent jīva acquire independence? 

Look at what Sri Rāmānuja says while commenting on verses 16-18 of 15th Adhyāya of Gīta 

akṣaraśabdanirdiṣṭaḥ kūṭasthaḥ acitsamsargaviyuktaḥ svena rūpeņa avasthito muktātmā |...uttamaḥ puruṣaḥ tu tābhyāṁ kṣarākṣarāśabdanirdiṣṭābhyāṁ baddhamuktapuruṣābyām anyaḥ arthāntarabhūtaḥ paramātmā iti udāhṛtaḥ

Rāmānujabhāsya for 15 - 16, 15-17, 15-18

- रामानुजभाष्य - १५-१६, १५-१७, १५-१८ 

"The liberated soul, termed as aksara, is also termed as kūtastha, for having no contact with insentient, remains in its own form. (enjoying his own bliss, even though controlled by Paramātma). The Supreme Being, one Who is distinct from both unliberated and liberated souls, and known as Paramātma, is much higher than them. Thus by the stated inherent natures, and for the stated reasons, I am very much greater and for that reason, both in loka and veda, I am known as Purusottama". 

Thus even wrt the jīvas in liberation, the Lord is infinitely greater and equality of any kind between jīva and God is to be discareded by their own school. Sri Parakala yati appears to have gone against his own Acharya. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

ParakAla Yati asserts that only the baddhAtmAs show gradations and differences in enjoyment due to the contraction and expansion of the dharma bhūta jñānA. 

Siddhānta: 

It has been described extensively how śrutis clearly indicated that gradation of enjoyment pertains to muktātmās only, but not baddhātmās. Also it was explained earlier how the assertion that it pertains to baddhātmās leads to absurd conclusions. How can any one claim that the śruti speaks of gradation of ananda in an ever- fluctuating saMsāra that too of the devatas and keeps completely silent of what happens to muktātmās, when actually a constancy (steady state) is reached? 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The muktAs are constantly under the control of Sriman NArAyaNa and they derive their bliss only from Sriman NArAyaNa by doing kainkaryam and experiencing His kalyAna gunAs. 

Siddhānta: 

Sure. Muktas are under the control of Sriman Nārāyaṇa. They derive their bliss only from Sriman Nārāyaṇa by doing kainkaryam. Sure. What does it mean by "experiencing His kalyāņa guna-s". Does it mean they meditate upon those and derive bliss? Then that is fine too. How will any of these help? As stated earlier, it appears that this mixture of good and bad ideas is to support an ultimately incorrect concept. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

Also, BhagavAn has infinite dharma bhūta jñānA as well. 

Siddhanta: 

Where is this mentioned? It is obvious that the jñāna of the Lord is infinite. That is His svarūpajñāna itself. Why does he need this ever-dubious, non-existing and never-mentioned jñāna? Is thsi jñāna pertinent to saṀsāra? If so, the Lord never has any saMsāra? Obviously this is not same as svarupajñāna. What is it? Where is it 

mentioned? An imaginary role of making the non-existent dharma bhuta jnana as an equalizer between jīva and Brahman is incredulous. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

But for him, there is no contraction or expansion of His jñānA, and he is eternally free of karma. 

Siddhanta: 

To illustrate the mixyure of good and bad ideas, consider that this is like saying "He brought the hare's horn and put it on his table." The hare's horn is non-existing, but the table is real. In the same sentence, imaginary and real thngs are spoken of. 

— 

— 

"there is no contraction or expansion of His jñānA" what jñāna if it is svarupajñāna, then that is fine (as He is avikāri). If it is DBJ, then like a hare's horn, it is non-existent. 

— 

"he is eternally free of karma." Absolutely denies it. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

- 

no vedic thought 

His svarUpa jñānA and dharma bhūta jñānA both are all-pervading. 

Siddhanta: 

Again, one real and one imaginary thing are brought in. DBJ is non- existent. if the dhama bhūta jñāna of the mukta jīva is also infinite (because of infinite expansion), then like DBJ of Paramātma, the DBJ of every mukta jīva must also be all-pervading. That is totally wrong and not mentioned in any scripture. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

And while BhagavAn is 'avikArA' and His svarUpA does not undergo any changes, being Satyam, jñānam, Anantam, Anandam and Amalatvam, the dharma bhūta jñānA of bhagavAn undergoes transformations and manifests itself as the kalyAnA gunAs we know and love. 

Siddhanta: 

Let us review this conglomeration. One needs to separate the wheat from the chaff. 

"while Bhagavān is 'avikārA' and His svarūpa does not undergo any changes, being Satyam, jñānam, Anantam, Anandam and Amalatvam" Absolutely fine. 

— 

"the dharma-bhūta-jñānA of bhagavan undergoes transformations" First of all where is this DBJ mentioned? Secondly, the danger in bringing all these concepts which have absolutely no support in any scripture is that more often than not, they fail to handle these extraneous concepts and end up losing consistency. 

It was mentioned earlier - 

"there is no contraction or expansion of His jñānA" indication of absence of Vikara. 

- 

this is an 

"the dharma bhūta jñānA of bhagavAn undergoes transformations" is an indication of Vikara. 

this 

" while BhagavAn is 'avikArA' and His svarUpA does not undergo any changes, being Satyam, jñānam, Anantam, Anandam and Amalatvam" 

(1) 

"1 

the dharma bhūta jñānA of bhagavAn undergoes transformations and manifests itself as the kalyAnA gunAs" 

(2) 

Satyam, jñānam, Anantam, Anandam and Amalatvam guna-s or not? 

Are these kalyāņa 

(1) links them with Svarupa jñāna and (2) links them with DBJ (dharmabhūtajñāna). 

"the kalyAnA gunAs we know and love." Surely we Love. One good way to know them properly is not to link them with DBJ, which is like a hare's horn. They must first come to a conclusion as to where the seat for these kalyāņa guṇa-s is - Svarupa jñāna or DBJ ? 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Hence, the auspicious attributes of Brahman are simply different states of His dharma bhūta jñānA. 

Siddhanta: 

All the auspiciousness is shattered by calling them to be the states of an unsupported, non-scriptural and non-existing entity. When we know them to be auspicious, it is highly desirable to discard such dangerous assignments. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

SrinivAsAchAryA explains it in Yatindra Mata DIpikA. 

Siddhanta: 

Why is not mentioned in śāstras. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

Furthermore, having shown that the object of enjoyment is Brahman and not the intrinsic bliss of the Self (as imagined by the mAdhvAs), 

Siddhanta: 

When ice cream is the object of enjoyment for a person, no one thinks that the ice cream is the person. If they think like that or if they think that others think like that, the problem only lies with them. Surely, the person gets the joy, not the ice cream. It is high-time to snap out of all this confusion. 

"naija sukhānubhūti" means that anubhava is for the jiva only. Is there any doubt about that? There are extensive descriptions of mokṣa in Madhva śāstra. Is it mentioned anywhere that the muktas do not enjoy Brahman's company? 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

it is impossible to state a gradation in bliss because Brahman by His very nature is homogenous and cannot be divided into parts (Neha NAnAsti Kincana). 

Siddhanta: 

If "Brahman by His very nature is homogenous and cannot be divided into parts (Neha NAnAsti Kincana)", how and why will the bliss of all the other jivas become equal to that of Brahman ? 

Isn't it also important to realize that the Lord is greater than all the akṣaras also? 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Hence, enjoyment of Brahman would result in equal AnandA for all. 

Siddhānta: 

This is like saying "It is impossible to state a gradation of financial strength of all Microsoft employees, because Microsoft is financially strong. Hence employment in Microsoft would result in equal financial strength for all its employees and each employee will have same fiancial strength of Microsoft." 

The example is only to drive the pint. The flaw in the conclusion like that is very obvious. But to understand the flaw in things that 

are beyond pratyakṣa, the scriptures are the guide. If one starts discarding the scriptures by saying things like "oh, those statements are for baddha jivas.", that is simply disastrous. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Lastly, the objection that jivAs have limited capacities and hence, cannot enjoy Brahman's infinite gunAs to maximum extent is negated by the fact that dharma bhūta jñānA is infinitely expanded in mokṣa. 

Siddhānta: 

By waving the magic wand of DBJ made of hare's horn, if such impossible conclusions are drawn, then there is no end to such wild conjectures at all. If this magic wand can be used to draw an absurd conclusion that all the mukta jīvas have the same ananda, the same magic wand can be used by some one to draw more absurd conclusion that "DBJ expands in reverse of svarupa jñāna and so the most insignificant creature in saMsāra will have greatest bliss in mokṣa and the greatest being in saMsāra will have the least bliss in mokṣa, which is lot more than the bliss of the Lord as His DBJ will contract maximum" real crazy approach but where is the end for such wild conjectures? In matters of such great importance, let us not bring in concepts that are not supported in scriptures, that too that go against common sense as well as against scriptures. 

— 

— 

The absurdities of accepting DBJ have been extensively explained earlier on and there is no point in repeating them here. Calling them as facts will not make them facts. They have to be supported by scriptures and/or stand the scrutiny of logic and consistency. As pointed out this DBJ is leading them to self-contradictions leave alone other issues. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

ParakAla Yati gives an analogy. Just as a wife who is totally dependent on her husband and enjoys whatever her husband does, the JivA enjoys Brahman's svarUpa-rUpa-gunA-vibhUti. He adds that since Brahman enjoying His own gunAs as well, there is sAmyam in AnandA between Brahman and JivA. 

Siddhānta: 

The more the attempt at justification, the deeper th trouble. Too many flaws. 

1. It is hard to find a wife, who enjoys what ever her husband does. 

Let us assume that there is some wife, who actually enjoys what ever her husband does. 

2. It is against our pratyakṣa that both of them will have same joy. There is no mandate that any two individuals must have same joy. 

3. The husband also should enjoy what ever his wife does. That is just as the wife is pativrata, the husband must be a patnivrata. Even then there is no guarantee that their joys will be equal or same. 

4. How can the joy of doing an action and the joy of approving that action be the same? 

5. Here the example has another huge flaw in that, it is taking into account two almost similarly placed beings. That does not expose the seriousness of the situation. Then? 

6. Let us take the instance of Sri Ramachandra, when He ruled the Earth. A very ordinary person, or an ordinary animal or an ordinary bird in His kingdom approved all the actions of Sri Rama. Does that mean that the joy of that person, animal or bird is same as the joy of Sri Rama chandra? 

7. If the objection is that the example is not talking about Mukti, the wife and husband example is also not in Mukti. Sri Rama and his subject's example is much more realistic and hits right on our face the absurdity of ananda sāmya based on such frivolous examples and such horrible reasoning. 

Why would "the JivA enjoys Brahman's svarUpa-rUpa-gunA-vibhUti. He adds that since Brahman enjoying His own gunAs as well," mean that "there is sAmyam in AnandA between Brahman and JivA." 

Even assuming (just for a minute) that they get their joys from the same source, how can one conclude that they get equal joy? Just because an elephant and a tiny animal get the water from the same lake, would any one conclude that they drink same amount of water? What kind of logic is that? 

Where is it mentioned that every mukta jīva gets knows every thing about every guņa of the Brahman? 

If ananda-samya were true, then in addition to the following 

expressions 

— 

satyam jñānamamantam brahma | 

सत्यम् ज्ञानममन्तम् ब्रह्म। 

vijñānamānandam brahma | 

विज्ञानमानन्दम् ब्रह्म।yaḥ sarvajñaḥ sarvavid yasya jñānamayam tapaḥ | (for Brahman) 

यः सर्वज्ञः सर्वविद् यस्य ज्ञानमयम् तपः । 

there should also be following expressions 

satyam jñānamamantam muktaḥ | 

सत्यम् ज्ञानममन्तम् मुक्तः । 

vijñānamānandam muktaḥ | 

विज्ञानमानन्दम् मुक्तः। 

yaḥ sarvajñaḥ sarvavid yasya jñānamayam tapaḥ | (for mukta) 

यः सर्वज्ञः सर्वविद् यस्य ज्ञानमयम् तपः । 

They are just not there, 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

(Special Note: This also refutes the MAdhvA's view that Vishishtadvaita believe in equal 'status' of JivA with Brahman in 

mokṣa. 

Siddhānta: 

Jñāna and ananda are indicative of status and the status is indicative of jñāna and ānanda. How can the jiva be much less in status and still have jñāna and ananda equal to Brahman? Even granting that such is possible, the problem is not with the status. The problem is that in any guna, the jiva cannot even come any where near to God. That is given. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

The paramam sAmyam sruti states that JivA becomes equal in 6 gunas with Brahman. jñānA and AnandA, as explained here, are two. 

Siddhanta: 

This is another wild conjecture 

yadā paśyaḥ paśyate rukmavarṇam kartāramiśam puruşaṁ brahma yonim | tadā vidvān punyapāpe vidhūya nirañjanaḥ paramaṁ samyamupaiti || 

-

Taittiriya 3-1-3||

तैत्तिरीय ३-१-३ 

"When the jīva sees the golden effulgent Paramātma, the creator of the universe, ever-full in all guna-s, father of Chaturmukha Brahma, that aparokṣa jñāni gets rid of aniṣṭa aprārabdha punya and aprārabdha papa, untouched by future sins, similar to the Brahman, obtains svarūpa-sukha abhivyakti (manifestation of inherent bliss)." 

There is no mention of becoming equal in six guņa-s. The context clearly indicates that it is only similarity. When one sees the entire canon of śrutis and smṛtis, it is quite evident that the jiva can never equal Paramātma. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The JIVA is also Satya Sankalpan, since he only wants to serve Brahman, 

Siddhānta: 

Not just because he wants to serve Brahman, the jiva becomes "Satya Sankalpa". If that were the case, then many amuktas/baddha jivas, who want to serveBrahman wouldhave become "Satya sankalpa". The jiva becomes Satya sankalpa because he/she completed the sadhana and the Lord found the right time to grant mokṣa and the "satya sankalpatva". Still this "satya sankalpatva" of the jiva is dependent on the Lord. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

and Brahman is also Satya Sankalpan, since he has taken a vow to protect JivAs. 

Siddhanta: 

Not just because the Lord has taken a vow to protect jivas, He becomes "Satya Sankalpa". He is independent and eternally He is satya sankalpa and sarva svatantra. 

One should not have such mix-ups. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The JivA is also Satya KAman, since all his desires are fulfilled by Brahman. The desire is merely kainkaryam and anubhavam of BhagavAn. Brahman is, naturally, Satya KAman. 

Siddhanta: 

Just because both are satyasankalpa, just because both are jñāna ānanda ātmaka, concluding that they have equal bliss is similar to the following. 

X says "I and Y bot of us have bank accounts and so we are equal financially". In reality X has a few bucks in the account and Y has several billion dollars in the account. So, what is there in the account matters and not just the name or kind. 

Can every mukta jīva because of "satya kāmatva" and his desire to do kainkaryam, wish for the opportunity to do the 8 kinds of vyāpāra "jagat sriṣṭi, sthiti, laya, niyamana, etc" as kainkaryam of Bhagavān? 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The JivA is also decorated with BrahmAlankAram, as described by the Kaushitaki Upanishad, hence, this is another sAmyam. 

Siddhānta: 

Sure. That is another similarity. Four kinds of mukti are described in śāstras 

Sāyujya, Sārūpya, Sālokya and Sāmīpya. What they are referring is sārūpya. They may also have similar vaibhoga. All are similar only. No equal things. One who is only for kainkaryam even think of equality? 

Pūrvapaksa: 

Note that in all cases, the jivA does not achieve anything by his own will or effort. Everything is given by Brahman to the jivA, making the jivA totally dependent on Brahman. Hence, no sAmyam in 'status' as alleged by MAdhvAs.) 

Siddhanta: 

In the above example of X and Y, X may say "I am always dependent on Y and so we are not equal in status, but we are equal financially", despite X having just a few dollars and Y having several billion dollars. 

Let them forget about the status. It is perfectly fine, if they also agree that the Lord is much above the jiva in status. The question is about the absurd claim that the mukta jiva equals Paramātma in six qualities. 

"No sāmyam" in anything including status. There are no exceptions. The word omniscient is applicable to the Lord only and not to the 

mukta jīvas. Is that so hard to get? How can the jiva be equal to the Lord in jñāna and ananda ? 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The MAdhvAs believe that there are different kinds of AnandA, and hence, grades of enjoyment in mokṣa. The Vijayindra ParAjayA refutes this view, stating that only Brahman and nothing else is enjoyed in mokṣa. 

Siddhanta: 

Bhagavata does speak of kinds of mokṣa like Sayujya, sarūpya, sālokya and sāmīpya. 

The śruti vākyas that speak of gradation of bliss pertains to muktas. only, but not baddha-s. 

Sri Parakalayati's statements have to be discarded based on following Chandogya Upanișat statements.

"Vayu, Brahma, Bharati and Sarasvathi have no sarira abhimāna. Just like these four forsake their bodies by the grace of the Lord, reach Paramjyoti Paramātma and attain svarūpa ānanda āvirbhāva, the jīva also by the grace of the Lord, forsakes the body, reaches Paramjyoti Paramātma and attains svarūpa ānanda āvirbhāva. These liberated ones, by the grace of the Lord, in there (Vaikuntha), they eat, do Vihara, move about with their women, move in vehicles with those who got mukti along with them and also those who got mukti earlier on. 

Because of their absorption in Bhagavan's darśana ānanda, they forget themselves and others. The Lord only gives this svarūpa ānanda āvirbhāva and appoints Mukhyprāņa as his charioteer." 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The Vijayindra ParAjaya goes on to state that the example of different sacrifices yielding different pleasures cannot be compared to mokṣa. Because the objects of those sacrifices are different from one another and also are attained by performing bodily acts. Whereas the object of all upAyAs here is Brahman only, achievable only by bhakti and hence, there cannot be any grades in degree of bliss due to "less bhakti" or "more bhakti" since Brahman is homogenous. Mukti is available for all, and only Brahman is the source of enjoyment for all as well. 

Siddhanta: 

Why can't the 'example of different sacrifices yielding different pleasures be compared to mokṣa' ? Isn't the object of all the sacrifices God? That being the case, how can the objects of those sacrifices be different? Aren't the sacrifices based on vedas? They have to note the Kathopaniṣat vākya 

sarve veda yatpadamāmananti 

- 

सर्वे वेदा यत्पदमामनन्ति । 

- 

Kathopaniṣat 1-2-15 

- 

कठोपनिषत् - १-२-१५ 

"All the vedas extoll the Lord's svarupa." 

Do they think that Bhakti is not needed for performing the sacrifices 

? 

The grammatical structure of this writer is terribly flawed and leads to lot of ambiguity as well. Ambiguity and confusion are the easiest shelter sought by those, who have very weak position. 

Look at this sentence 

"Whereas the object of all upAyAs here is Brahman only, achievable only by bhakti and hence, there cannot be any grades in degree of bliss due to "less bhakti" or "more bhakti" since Brahman is homogenous. 

" 

"there cannot be any grades in degree of bliss" is the sadhya (to be proven). 

What is the hetu here? 

1. the object of all upāyās here is Brahman only. 

2. Brahman is achievable only by bhakti 

3. Brahman is homogenous. 

No matter what their claim is (one of them is hetu, some of them are hetu, all of them are hetu), there is no correlation between hetu and sādhya. 

Their understanding of equality itself is very defective. 

Even in day-to-day life, people have some good understanding of the word "equal or sama". For example, if one says "the teacher treats all his students equally", It means that the teacher treats them as per their performance and does not show any favoritism. No one would expect that the teacher will give equal marks to all the students in his class. Nor does it mean that if he conducts a running race or any other contest, he will give same first prize to all the students/contestants irrespective of how bad or good the student's performance is. If the teacher really does so, they will say that the teacher is terrible. That being the case, what a terrible quality they are attributing to the Lord, that too by stating that not only the Lord gives the same bliss to the "kali puruşa", but also the same bliss as what He has. Nothing is a greater disaster than this. 

Then they claim that the mukti is available for all. This means that they are claiming that Lord Krishna is a liar as He clearly says in Bhagavadgita 

aśraddadhānāḥ puruşa dharmasyasya parantapa | aprāpya māṁ nivartante mṛtyusaṁsāravartmani ||

"Oh tormentor of the enemies, those who do not trust this knowledge, 

will not attain me and struggle in the ways of the mrutyu rūpa saMsāra." 

"These cruel haters, worst of men, I always throw them into saMsāra (cycles of birth and death) and into demonical wombs. 

Then O Kunti's son, these fools, having acquired the demonical wombs, recursively every birth, never reach me and attain the abysmal hellish realms." 

From this, it is crystal clear that mukti is not available to all. Further, claiming that those who do very great Bhakti like chaturmukha Brahma and those who do very little bhakti get same bliss in mokṣa and even worse claiming that the haters of the Lord also get that same bliss will attribute "vaiṣamya doṣa" (flaw of partiality in Lord. "sameṣu viṣamabuddhi" or "viṣameşu samabuddhi" is vaiṣamya doșa. Treating as per what they deserve is real samabuddhi. 

Then as usual they just throw a statement that need not be objected 

to - 

Brahman is the source of enjoyment for all that is fine. 

These general statements have no bearing what so ever on their wild claims. 

Further the gradation of bliss in mokşa is also clearly stated in Brahma sutra 

"OM vṛddhihrāsabhāktvamantarbhāvādubhayasāmañjasyādevam OM" 

ॐ वृद्धिहासभात्त्वमन्तर्भावादुभयसामंजस्यादेवम् ॐ 

Brahmasutra 

- ब्रह्मसूत्र - ३-२-२० 

— 

3-2-20 

"There is increase and decrease (gradation) in bliss due to difference in jñāna and bhakti, for only then impartiality of the Lord towards both would be seen". 

When a question comes "Why is that so?", that is answered by the next sutra - 

"OM darśanācca OM" 

ॐ दर्शनाच्च ॐ 

"Because it is seen in the Vedas.". 

Brahmasutra -3-2-21 

- 

ब्रह्मसूत्र - ३-२-२१ 

So, if the Visiṣṭādvaitins think that the statements of Taittiriya and Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣat vākyas are for baddha jīvas only, they should still concede that there should be some other Vedic statements that 

speak of gradation of bliss. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

In other words, bhakti, whether done in less quantity or more, results in only one end, namely mokşa. Vedic yajnAs are many, have different results and require bodily means. But BhagavAn is one and the same for all. 

Siddhanta: 

Again a typical conglomeration. 

bhakti, whether done in less quantity or more, results in only one end, namely mokṣa. - The question is not whether all the deserving ones showing right kind of Bhakti reach mokṣa or not. The question is whether there every one including the most tāmasik ones get the same amount of the bliss as the Lord Himself. 

Vedic yajnAs are many, have different results and require bodily 

means. 

1 

- If a point is made that the subject of Bhakti is God and so the bliss in mokṣa is same, then by the same logic, since the subject of yajñas is God and that too requires bhakti, then the fruits of all vedic yajñas must be the same. Are the Visiṣṭādvaitins aware that the mokṣa sadhana also requires bodily means? Even they wont speak of mokṣa sādhane after reaching mokṣa. 

- 

But BhagavAn is one and the same for all.. Isn't Bhagavan propounded by the Vedic yajñas ? There is double trouble here. It is a big logical loop-hole that 'Bhagavan is one and the same for all' does not imply that the outcome of bliss should be the same for all. Secondly accepting that just for a minute will lead to other difficulties like the Vedic yajñas should also yield the same result. Further such a weird claim attributes vaiṣamya doșa to the Lord. The worst thing is this. The greatest sinners also get the same bliss as Chaturmukha Brahma. And all of them get the same bliss as Bhagavan. And the reason is given that it is so because the source is the same !! 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

(Special Note: It is my observation that MAdhvA"s assumption that Prapatti being easier than Bhakti is wrong as well. PrapannAs also have to follow a code of conduct, far beyond the reach of baddhAtmAs like ourselves. PrapannAs need a thorough knowledge of rahasyas, and have two options, to either spend their life propagating Ubhaya VedAntA, or indulging in Yoga for Bhagavan"s sake. Note that Yoga is not done as UpAyA by prapannAs, but as a kainkaryam to Bhagavan. This was explained by Sri Velukkudi Swami in a UpanyAsam. 

Siddhanta: 

Suppose a person gives a statement 

"Having a gun alone is not enough to go to a battle field; one must also have the training how to use the gun, must also strategize how to fight, etc." 

Then it is not wise to say the person is asking not to take the gun. to the battle field. 

Also look at the kind of argument that is being made. 

It is my observation that MAdhvA"s assumption that Prapatti being easier than Bhakti is wrong as well. This is an extremely flawed observation. 

There are two parts here. 

1. Prapatti is wrong. 

— 

2. The reason for that is because it is easier than Bhakti. 

First of all, he never said 1. 

Secondly, 2. is even more flimsy and he never said 2. 

It is this writer's assumption that Acharya Madhva assumed that. 

It is strange that people hear a few upanyasams and jump to rash conclusions without proper study of all the relevant texts. 

Isn't Bhakti required for kainkaryam as well? What is their understanding of prapatti without Bhakti ? How can there be a true bhakti without proper jñāna ? If there is true jñāna, which 

encompasses true Bhakti, which inturn encompasses true prapatti, then that is a whole package. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

But this does not indicate partiality on the part of brahman, ie giving equal mokṣa for all. 

Siddhanta: 

It does indicate partiality. Also it goes against many scriptural statements and it is irrational as well. 

It is one thing to say mokṣa for all (which is wrong by itself) and then to make it worse, it is claimed that equal mokṣa is given to all. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The PancarAtrA quotes PerumAl saying, 'I accept Bhakti and Prapatti. 

For differences in the two paths, please refer articles on the net or consult a vidwAn.) 

Siddhanta: 

Referring articles on the net or consulting a vidwān or referring some works are truly necessary acts, but not sufficient. 

No one denies that Lord accepts Bhakti and Prapatti. No where is it mentioned that all get equal bliss. 

It is natural that other schools get perturbed when they hear that Acahrya Madhva refuted 21 schools, the main ones that came until then. But proof of the pudding is in its eating. 

We hear very conflicting statements like 

— 

1. True jñāna alone is needed for attaining liberation. (nānyah panthā ayanāya vidyate | ) ( नान्यः पन्था अयनाय विद्यते । ) 

2. Karma alone is needed for attaining liberation. 

(karmaṇyevādhikāraste), (niyatam_kuru karma..) (कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते ), (नियतम् 

कुरु कर्म ...) 

3. There are two paths 

— 

loke-asmin dvividha niṣṭhā 

(jñānayogena sāMkhyānām karmayogena yoginām) ( ज्ञानयोगेन सांख्यानाम् कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम्) 

3. Bhakti alone is needed for attaining liberation. 

(nähamvedairna tapasā...bhaktyā tvananyaya sakya...) (नाहम् वेदैर्न तपसा ...भक्त्या त्वनन्यया शक्य....) 

4. Prapatti alone is needed for attaining liberation. 

(sarva dharmān parityajya māmekam śaranam vraja) (सर्व धर्मान् परित्यज्य मामेकम् 

शरणम् व्रज) 

If one goes thru all the commentaries, it becomes self-evident, how other schools just got lost and gave very inconsistent replies that dont even hold water and how Acharya Madhva gave brilliant 

interpretation.A true Prapatti is not possible without proper Bhakti. A true Bhakti is not possible without proper jñāna. Proper karma is not possible without proper jñāna. 

jñāna mārga and karmamārga that were mentioned is based on prāchurya and so on. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

ParakAla Yati states that BrahmAnandam is not exclusively enjoyed by Brahman only. 

Siddhanta: 

- 

"BrahmAnandam is not exclusively enjoyed by Brahman only" This is a meaningless statement because of the inherent ambiguity. What is meant by the expression Brahmanandam ? In case of Brahman, it is Brahmaṇaḥ Anandam. It is His own bliss. In case of others, it can mean the bliss obtained by thinking about Brahman and also that is also controlled by Brahman, given by Brahman, brought to experience by Brahman, etc. The Lord does not give His own bliss to others. The jīva does not have the capacity to experience his own bliss without the grace, control and approval of the Lord. 

People have to have some basic understanding of the qualities like jñāna and ānanda, as to how they function, regarding giving, taking, sharing, etc. 

If one shares material things woth another, then there will be dimunition of that entity - like if 5 people share 5 bananas equally, each gets only one banana. Sharing knowledge and joy is like lighting a lamp. If X gives his knowledge to Y, the knowledge of X does not come down at all. Similarly if X gives happiness to Y, under normal conditions, the joy of X does not have to come down. Here the giving or sharing does not diminish the entity. 

Secondly, it is not even possible or practical for X to give his entire knowledge to Y. Similarly it is not possible for X to give his entire joy to Y. 

Thirdly, the gradations take effect every step of the way. The following explanation of knowledge holds good to bliss as well. 

If we take persons say X1, X2, X3, X4, etc, each will have different levels of knowledge (the subjects or kinds itself varies so much and to make it a little simpler, let us restrict to the spiritual knowledge and spiritual joy alone). 

Even if we take persons of same or similar levels, their desire/willingness to give/share varies. Their capacities to give/share varies again. 

Let us say Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, etc are the receivers of jñāna or ananda. Again how much they receive and how much they retain varies according to their yogyata. 

Thus the Lord makes the jīva experience the jīva's inherent bliss, when it is right time (that is after mukti). Even materialistic joy is given by Him only. He alone is svatatntra and every one else is dependent on him. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

He provides examples once again such as the wife enjoying her husband's gunAs, the student enjoying his teacher"s and the son enjoying his parents. 

Siddhanta: 

/ 

Any school of philosophy that wishes to establish advocate a major philosophical principle has to resort to one of the three pramāṇa-s pratyakṣa or anubhava (pratyakṣa has to be parīkṣita or verified) āgama (nirdoṣa śabda is āgama) anumāna (logic utilizing pratyakşa and/or agama). The apparent meanings of agama are as misguiding as the apparent appearances of things. While Advaita has found its strength (or weakness so to speak) in superficial meanings of agama vākyas, it resorted to second level of defense by desperately searching for examples, by which they were equally misguided if not 

more. 

Firstly examples are never a prof for any philsophical principle. Secondly the more we analyze those examples, the more evident the weakness turns out to be. 

It is very strange that Visiṣṭādvaita, which quite successfully pointed out many flaws of Advaita, is trying to take much weaker approach than Advaita. Without even the support of atleast a few glaringly apparent agama vākyas (except for only one apparent statement "paramam samyamupaiti"), they are trying to advocate a major concept of equal bliss as the Lord for every jiva including the eternal haters of the Lord. That statement not only has other meaning like 'just similarity', but not equality, the equality interpretation goes against many other pramāņa-s. The examples that they have chosen are more damaging to their position itself. 

I have elaborately pointed out the flaw in wife and husband example. The same kind of flaw decorates student-teacher example and son- father example. Heavy confusion is introduced by using expressions like one enjoying the other's guna-s. In an eagerness to justify the example, one enjoying the other's guna-s is interpreted as one approving the other's guņa-s. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The muktA realizes that he is the SarIrA (and hence, SeshA) of Brahman, and this alone is enough to give him infinite AnandA. 

Siddhanta: 

There is not a single pramāņa that says that jīva is the śarIra of Brahman. Added to that as poiinted out earlier, that leads to several flaws. Again what has such a realization to do with infinite ananda? That alone is enough? Where is the pramāņa? That too that alone is enough? Then the following question arises. 

Does a jñāni in baddha state realize that he is the śarIra of Brahman. In particular, does their own Acharya and other glorious ones in their parampara realize that? If they don't without any agama pramāṇa how are they claiming that? If they do, then in amukta/baddha state itself they must be getting infinite ananda, as that alone is enough (meaning there is no need for prārabdha to be completed, etc.) 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

This does not decrease the status of Brahman in anyway. 

Siddhanta: 

This is what is called straw man argument. The reason for rejecting their position is not that 'it is going to decrease the status of Brahman in anyway'. The reasons for rejecting their position is absence of any valid pramāņa and also that it goes against many other pramāṇa-s. One cannot argue "This does not decrease the status of Brahman in anyway and so let us accept it". Such an approach is invalid. For accepting any position, it must have valid pramāṇa-s and it should not go against other valid pramāṇa-s. Their position lacks both. It does not have valid pramāṇa-s and it goes against other valid pramāṇa-s. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

(Special Note: Perumal is described as "Madhu", "Annam", "AramudE", etc. He derives anandA from His own nature, but we can enjoy it as well, just as we enjoy the qualities of Madhu, Annam and "Aramudham". 'Unnum Choru, Parugum Neer....' is a famous pAsuram). This, in brief, is a refutation of the Ananda TAratamya. Let us note that our pUrvAchAryAs" interpretation of AnandA in mokṣa is based completely on Nammazhwar"s "Uyarvara Uyarnalam" pathigam. 

Siddhanta: 

Very strange argument in deed. Let us list what is being said 

1. Perumal is described as "Madhu". 

2. He derives anandA from His own nature 

3. But, we can enjoy it as well 

4. just as we enjoy the qualities of Madhu 

This, in brief, is a refutation of the Ananda TAratamya. 

Is this for real? How can the above set prove that our joy is the same as Perumal's joy? How can a figurative expression about entity A, used by entity B prove that the bliss of B equals to bliss of A ? 

This is like going to a car dealer to buy the car and he shows a refrigerator that has 4 wheels. He tells "Like a car this has four wheels. Just as you get cool air in the car, you get cool air in this. So this is your car." 

The above example of Perumal, madhu and the jivas is like 

1. A parent calls his/her child "Honey" (madhu). 

2. The child derives ānanda from His own nature 

3. But, the parents can enjoy it as well 

4. Just as parents enjoy the qualities of honey (madhu) 

leading to the conclusion that the joy of the child equals to the joy of the parents always. People can even get very excited and further say "when the child cries, the parents cry, when the child is happy, the parents are happy. So, they are equal in joy.". 

In the latter example, atleast there is some possibility for them to be equal. But in the Permual and jīva example, the joy of the jiva can be nowhere near that of Perumal. 

The humans, animals and birds all have great affinity for food and water. Not only they satisfy the hunger and thirst, they also give susteance and energy. They are essential for the existence. 

The devotees in the form of men extolled Lord's forms and Lord's names as food and water. That has multi-level significance. They express the love of devotees for the Lord. Even deeper than that is the concept that the Lord is present in all the foods and water and gives sustenance to all. 

Note that Sri Purandara Dāsaru says 

"Rāma nāma pāyasakke Kṛṣṇa nāma sakkare Viṭṭhala nāma tuppava berasi baya capparīsiro..." 

"1 

राम नाम पायसक्के कृष्ण नाम सक्करे विट्ठल नाम तुप्पव बेरसि बाय चप्परीसिरो.... 

It is a ridiculous claim that this kind of extolling the Lord refutes ānanda tāratamya and that this establishes ānanda-sāmya. 

Thus describing, extolling and comparing the Lord to "Madhu", 

"Annam", "AramudE", 

'Unnum Choru, Parugum Neer....', etc in no way speak of Ananda sāmya. 

What the Visiṣṭādvaitins did was labelling the pure devotees that were before Sri Rāmānuja as "Alwars" and falsely interpreted their works to suit the Visiṣṭādvaita position. Kulasekhara Maharaja was never called alwar before the advent of Sri Rāmānuja. Even the above comparison of 'Unnum Choru, Parugum Neer...." to the Lord by Nammalwar does not convey any ananda-saamya. In addition to the absence of statements that support their position from standard scriptures, their futile efforts to interpret these external works also incorrectly shows the amount of desperation they are in. But the simple question is "Why?" 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Also, an interesting point to note is that Sri ParakAla Yati has not only refuted the idea of gradations in bliss, but has also refuted jiva bhedA 

Siddhanta: 

What is interesting is to note that just as the effort to refute the idea of gradations in bliss fizzled out, so also the refutation of the jiva bheda will fizzle out. What they mean is actually jīvatraividhya as they also have to believe in jīva bheda otherwise there will not be a debate/argument/discussion between two persons, two groups, etc. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

by explaining that the difference in anandA in samsAris is due to expansions and contractions of dharma bhūta jñānA. 

Siddhanta: 

11 

First of all, there is no such thing as dharma-bhūta-jñānA" of their interpretation. It is not Vritti jñāna as they claim that it will continue into mokṣa. It is not svarupa jñāna as they themeselves claim so. Like hare's horn, it is non-existent. Talking about its contraction and expansion is same as talking about the color of hare's horn. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

This effectively quells the MAdhvA argument that JivAs are intrinsically different because they have different likes and dislikes. 

Siddhanta: 

No one has to quell these arguments. They have all been self- 

destructive. 

Without a single scriptural support and without a single logical 

reasoning, how could they make such a claim? It is like a bubble that has already burst. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The Sruti 'Yasya AtmA SarIram' and numerous other Vedic/PurAnic vAkyAs assert that JivA is the body of BhagavAn, and hence, subservient to BhagavAn. 

Siddhanta: 

There is absolutely no regard for context, no regard for consistency. We cannot take superficial meanings for vedic statements. Just as mahavakyas do not speak of identity of Jiva and Brahman, the statements saying somethingas shrIra of God do not literally mean that the God has them as His sharIra. We have to take them "like sharIra only". Just because we are inside a vehicle and control the vehicle, the vehicle does not become our body. 

In Brhadaranyakopanişat (बृहदारण्यकोपनिषत्), Gautama asks yajñavalkya 

(अन्तर्यामिणम् ब्रूहि) 

antaryāmiņam brūhi (34) (explain me about the Lord's antaryāmitva). 

This is in Antaryāmi brāhmana (अन्तर्यामि ब्राह्मण) .

The Upaniṣat goes on describing the similar thought wrt Water, Fire, Antarikṣa, Vayu, Dyu, vijñāna etc. Note that we have to take infact the abhimani devats for these tatvas. 

While in this upaniṣat, it is said 

"yo vijñāne tiṣṭhan vijñānādantaro, yam vijñānam na veda, yasya

In MahamimaMsa, the abhimani devatas are explained. Pṛthivi pūrṇa Hari

Both Vijñāna and ātma are described as Chaturmukha Brahma. (ātmā vijñānamiti tu sarvajīvābhimānavān brahmaivoktastvime...) 

(आत्मा विज्ञानमिति तु सर्वजीवाभिमानवान् ब्रह्मैवोक्तस्त्विमे...) 

The basic concept is that it is about Sarvāntryāmitva. 

What has this to do with refuting jīva traividhya? 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Therefore, all jivAs are subservient. 

Siddhanta: 

— 

Prthu = 

Of course. This is slipping in a valid statement, that gives no support to their position. If the jivas are subservient to God, they must have the basic awareness that they are inferior to God in every respect, including the jñāna, ānanda and every guņa. 

Purvapaksa: 

Since a body serves a soul willingly, 

Siddhanta: 

A big fall. The body is jaḍa. How can a jaḍa have willingness? 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

all jivAs possess the essential nature to serve Him willingly. 

Siddhanta: 

Then Lord Krishna must have had some kind of delusions or 

hallucinations, when He condemned the tāmasik souls in Bhagavadgita in several instances. Those who do not believe that Krishna had delusions must reject this position of Visiṣṭādvaita. 

Not only Gita, there are other sources that support the position that there are inherently tāmasik souls. Apart from several Gīta sentences supporting jīva traividhya and tāmasik souls, there are also several Bhagavata and other purāņa statements, there are Vedic statements, there are Mahabharata and Ramayana statements that support this position. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Hence, there can be no 'tAmasic' or 'rAjasic' jivAs when they all have the same intrinsic nature to serve Sriman NArAyaNa willingly. 

Siddhanta: 

See above for the total rejection of this position. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

Swami Desikan gives the following pramAnAs to show that JivA is omniscient in mokşa due to expanded dharma bhūta jñānA: CU 7.26-2: Sarvam ha pasya: pasyathi SarvamApnOthi Sarvasa: (Meaning): Muktha Jeevan sees every thing in parama padham and through or h the power of his own sankalpam enjoys every thing at all times and is immersed in ParipoorNa BrhmAnandham 

Siddhanta: 

Here Sarva does not mean "every thing". That is not even the purpose. Here Sarva refers to the Lord. Note that Viṣṇu Sahasra nāma also has 

"sarvaḥ śarvaḥ śivaḥ sthānuḥ.." (Hd: zd: fia: T21:...). Secondly, the 

context also calls for such an interpretation Lord, obtaining/reaching the Lord. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

— 

the jiva seeing the 

(Sa vaa yEsha yEthEna dhivyEna chakshushA manasaithAn kaamAn pasyan RAMATHE, ya yEthE Brahma 10kE: CU 8.12.5). 

Siddhanta: 

It is shocking that they think that this statement refers to jīva. How could they ignore the very next statement ? 

tam vā etam devā ātmānamupāsate । (तम् वा एतम् देवा आत्मानमुपासते । ) (The gods 

worship such Lord as the controller of all indriyas). 

If their interpretation means that it is jīva, that would imply that 

the next statement indicates that all the gods worship the jiva. That is terrible. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The following Sruti VAkyA shows that JivA enjoys Brahman in mokşa: "yo vai bhUmA thath sukham yathra nAnyath paSyathi nAnyath SruNothi nAnyath vijAnAthi sa bhUmA". 

Siddhanta: 

What is the context for this and how does this entire portion of śruti vākya runs and what it means - we will see further down. Even before that, with their own interpretation, let us see if they achive what they like. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

"The bhUmA is the greatest. 

Siddhanta: 

Since jīva is not the greatest, naturally they also mean that bhūmā refers to God. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

It pervades everywhere and is sarva-viSishtam. It is bliss-self and thus everything. 

Siddhanta: 

That should also be fine 

— 

He is everything means that He controls 

everything. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

He who enjoys this, never sees other 

sees other things..." 

Siddhanta: 

W 

Surely, having reached Paramātma, the mukta jīva sees Paramātma everywhere and also is not interested in anything else. One sees only Lord never has to mean that One knows the Lord completely or knows everything completely. 

It is very clear that they lost the whole flow and purpose. They keep ending up self-contradicting as well. 

The entire śruti passage goes like this - 

'yo vai bhūmā tatsukham | nālpe sukhamasti | bhūmaiva sukham | bhūmā tveva vijijñāsitavya iti bhūmānaṁ bhagavo vijijñāsa' iti ।।

"As support for the above, this sloka goes The mukta does not see the anarthas like death, disease, and despair. He sees the activities of the Lord, he obtains the sarva nāmaka Paramātma. He fulfills all of his own deires. He takes one, three, five, seven, nine, eleven, hundred and eleven, thousand and twenty, etc forms." 

It is quite evident that none of these point out any thing even 

remotely that the jñāna and ānanda of the jiva equals that of Brahman. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

With infinite jñānA, JivA is omniscient and enjoys Brahman. This means, JivA has infinite anandA. 

Siddhanta: 

A blind repetition of the same phrase without any supporting evidence will not make that statement true. Only Brahman is omniscient and the jīva is not. jīva enjoying Brahman is not like a boy enjoying a toy. One must have the realization that the expression "jīva enjoys Brahman" means that the jiva enjoys thru the Brahman, from the grace of the Brahman, by seeing Brahman and experiencing the company of the Brahman and especially in mokṣa to the fulll extent of the jiva's capacity. If the expression "X enjoys Brahman" implies that X is omniscient and has equal ananda as Brahman, then all the "Nanda vraja people" must also be omnixcient and have ananda equal to that of Brahman. Then to avoid such a mess, a bigger mess is brought in thru "DBJ", which is not there any where in the scriptures and which is like a magic wand in the hands of Visiṣṭādvaita, by waving which all kinds of claims are made going aginst the scriptures. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

It should be noted that jivA, though having infinite dharma bhūta jñānA still is anU with regards to svarUpA. Just as sun is localised, but sun rays can spread everywhere, JivA is anU, but it radiates knowledge. 

Siddhanta: 

This is due to the confusion between jñāna and prakāśa. If they think that prakāśa itself is jñāna, then a tube light or a burning candle will have to be considered as having jñāna. jñāna is not visible to the eye, Prakāśa is. jñāna does not pervade into space, Prakāśa does. So bringing jñāna into picture and talking about size, shows heavy confusion. Also what is this DBJ? Is it same as Vritti jñāna or different? If it is different, then every living being has three kinds of jñāna Svarupa jñāna, Vritti jñāna and DBJ. And their contention is that this DBJ is carried into mokṣa as well. Where is this located? If it is in Svarupa, then its contraction and expansion, etc indicate the vikāra for the svarupa. If it is not in Svarupa, how can it be carried over into mokṣa?

This knowledge allows cognition of BhumA (Brahman) and enjoy its 

infinite qualities. 

Siddhanta: 

Then what is the role of Svarupa jñāna? The svarupa jñāna does not allow the cognition of Brahman, but DBJ does? So the Svarupa jñāna in mokṣa is significantly useless compared to DBJ !! 

Pūrvapaksa: 

Other pramAnAs for dharma bhūta jñānA are the vAkyAs like 'He becomes one-fold, three fold....many fold', in Chandogya Up., which state that the muktA can assume multiple bodies at once. MuktA is anU, so the only way for him to assume so many bodies is by his jñānA. Although the AtmA remains localised, it can control several bodies by its jñānA. 

We have purAnic stories of some rishis controlling 50 bodies at once. This is because due to their tapas, their dharma bhūta jñānA was extended sufficiently for them to execute such an act. In mokşa, this jñānA is infinite. 

Siddhanta: 

Another quagmire. If the muktas assuming multiple bodies in mokṣa is an evidence for DBJ expanding to infinity in mokṣa, then those "some ṛṣis" (It is actually Soubhari) also must be considered as having this DBJ expanded to infinity in saMsāra itself (no need to wait till mokṣa). 

This DBJ acts like an equalizer 

— 

making each one's DBJ expand in succh a way that they equal the anada of Brahman. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Additional Notes from Sri Ranga Rāmānuja Muni's BhAshyA on Anandavalli of Taittiriya Upanishad 

The theme of Ananda MimAmsa is to determine whether BrahmAnandA can be measured. The Upanishads assume one unit" of AnandA for manushyAs and go on to BrahmAnandA, stating later on Yato Vacho Nivartante....“ The words "Shrotriyasya cAkAmahatasya" follow each verse, which mean "One whose study of Vedas has fructified" and "One who is free of desire". This, according to Upanishad BhAshyakArAr, pertains to muktAs. These words are present to indicate that a muktA also possesses all these anandAs, no matter how much they are multiplied, since a muktA is the enjoyer of all anandA, without exception. 

//.... 

So, the Upanishad is translated as follows, this is one unit of manushya ananda. Multiply by 100, this is one unit of ananda for 

11 

manushya gandharvas and also for a muktA..... And so on until we reach, Multiply Praj Apati"s (Brahma) AnandA by 100, we get one unit of BrahmAnandA, and also for a muktA". This statement does not mean Brahman"s anandA is only 100 times greater than Brahma "s. Sri Ranga Rāmānuja Muni explains that this is just an expression. We say "Sun is moving as fast as an arrow ". In reality, the sun is moving so fast that the arrow's motion appears slow by comparison. Similarly, Brahman"s anandA is many times greater than Brahma "s, and 100 times is just a figure of expression. 

Siddhanta: 

This is a complete loss of ground! Only one thing is meaningful here that 100 is just symbolic only and it signifies just several fold. 

The śruti vākyas were given and explained earlier in this write up. 

Let me reproduce a small part here 

— 

One hundred bliss units of Mukta chakravartis = one bliss unit of Mukta Manuşya Gandharvas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravana phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become āptakāmas). 

One hundred bliss units of Mukta Manuşya Gandharvas = one bliss unit of Mukta Deva Gandharvas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravana phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become āptakāmas). 

= 

One hundred bliss units of Mukta Deva Gandharvas one bliss unit of Mukta pity devatas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravana phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become aptakāmas). 

One hundred bliss units of Mukta pitṛ devatas = one bliss unit of Mukta ajānaja devatas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravana phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become aptakāmas). 

= 

One hundred bliss units of Mukta ajānaja devatas one bliss unit of Mukta karmaja devatas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravana phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become aptakāmas). 

and then it continues from Mukta Karmaja devatas to Mukta devatas, etc. upto Chaturmukha Brahma. 

Note that in each case, the two words "śrotriyasya" and "akāmahatasya" are repeated tirelessly to avoid any confusion and to emphasize that this is "ananda mīmāMsa of mukta jīvas only, not 

amukta jivas. 

If Sri Ranga Rāmānuja thinks that "this is one unit of ananda for manushya gandharvas and also for a mukta....." 

and they want to mix amukta and mukta, then I can only think of two possibilities 

Possibility-1 : 

100 bliss units of of Amukta chakravartis = 1 bliss unit of Amukta Manuşya Gandharva = 1 bliss unit of Mukta Manuşya Gandharva 

= 

1 bliss unit of 

100 bliss units of of Amukta Manuşya Gandharvas Amukta Deva Gandharva = 1 bliss unit of Mukta Deva Gandharva 

100 bliss units of of Amukta Deva Gandharvas = 1 bliss unit of Amukta 

pitṛ devata = 1 bliss unit of Mukta pity devata 

100 bliss units of of Amukta pitṛ devata = 1 bliss unit of Amukta ajānaja devata = 1 bliss unit of Mukta ajānaja devata 

100 bliss units of Amukta ajānaja devatas = 1 bliss unit of Amukta karmaja devata = 1 bliss unit of Mukta karmaja devata 

etc. upto Chaturmukha Brahma. 

This implies that the bliss of Amukta is same as bliss of Mukta in each category. 

That is terrible. And aslo this still carries a variation among Mukta jīvas. This goes against their own position. 

Possibility-2: 

100 bliss units of of Amukta chakravartis = 1 bliss unit of Amukta 

Manuşya Gandharva = 1 bliss unit of an arbitrary Mukta M1 

100 bliss units of of Amukta Manuşya Gandharvas = 1 bliss unit of Amukta Deva Gandharva = 1 bliss unit of an arbitrary Mukta M1 (the same M1) 

100 bliss units of of Amukta Deva Gandharvas 

= 

1 bliss unit of Amukta 

pity devata = 1 bliss unit of an arbitrary Mukta M1 (the same M1) 

100 bliss units of of Amukta pity devata = 1 bliss unit of Amukta ajānaja devata = 1 bliss unit of an arbitrary Mukta M1 (the same M1) 

100 bliss units of Amukta ajānaja devatas = 1 bliss unit of Amukta karmaja devata 1 bliss unit of an arbitrary Mukta M1 (the same M1) 

etc. upto Chaturmukha Brahma. 

= 

This is probably even worse. The bliss of M1 is very indetrminate and 

arbitraily equated with many. Yet due to equating with amuktas, it is not infinite either. This goes against their own position. 

May be there is another possibility that they can interpret this as. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

MAdhvAs unfortunately, have not comprehended the intent of Ananda MimAmsA. 

Siddhanta: 

Unfortunately only a poor understanding and a weak position could lead one to a conclusion that the Madhvas have not comprehended !! 

Especially since the the intent and the words of the Shruti are both very clear and loud. One has to just pay attention to understand this basic concept. 

Also note the following statements from Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣat 

eşă'sya paramā gatiḥ | eṣa'sya paramā sampat | eşo'sya paramo lokah | eşo'sya parama ānandah | etasyaivā''nandasyānyāni bhūtāni mātrāmupajīvanti || 

एषाऽस्य परमा गतिः। एषाऽस्य परमा संपत् । 

एषोऽस्य परमो लोकः। एषोऽस्य परम आनन्दः । 

- Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣat 

4-32 

— 

एतस्यैवाऽऽनन्दस्यान्यानि भूतनि मात्रामुपजीवन्ति॥ 

- 

बृहदारण्यकोपनिषत् - ४-३२ 

"Lord Visņu pervades the entire universe. His sampat is infinitely complete. His jñāna is all complete. His bliss is infinitely complete. Other muktas experience an infinitesimal amount of His bliss." 

Pūrvapaksa: 

The whole purpose is to celebrate BrahmAnandA and its incalculable nature, 

Siddhanta: 

Their interpretation is no celebration, but just the opposite. How can equating the bliss of an ordinary jīva with that of Supreme Lord be called a celebration. It is totally rejecting the supremacy of the Lord. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

but instead, they think its purpose is to enumerate the AnandAs of baddha and mukta jivAs, based on their status of Indra, Brahma, Manushya, etc. which are permanent. 

Siddhanta: 

One has to call a spade a spade. Calling by any other name will not make a spade a non-spade. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

Note that manushya AnandA is not followed by 'Shrotriya'. 

Siddhanta: 

Of course not. One must have a basic understanding of the whole thing. 

When an invisible aspect of ananda MīmāMsa of Muktas (liberated) is enlisted, it must have a starting point that we can comprehend. 

"tasyeyam pṛthivI sarvā vittasya pūrṇā syāt sa eko mānuṣa ānandaḥ 

| |..." 

तस्येयम् पृथिवी सर्वा वित्तस्य पूर्णा स्यात् । स एको मानुष आनन्दः। . 

When we want to start the basic unit of Mukta chakravarti, how do we go about? How much is 1 unit of bliss of Mukta chakravarti? Before going to mokşa (i.e. in saMsāra), in Tretayuga, when the Earth is full of prosperity, and the chakravarti rules this entire Earth, what ever bliss he gets multiply that by 100 and that will be 1 unit of his bliss, when he goes to mokṣa. So, 

100 bliss units of Amukta (unliberated) mānuṣa chakravarti (when he rules the entire Earth filled with propserity) = 1 bliss unit when He ges to mokṣa. 

Just observe how ānanda mīmāMsā starts - 

saiṣā''nandas ya mīmāMsā bhavati | yuva syātsādhuyuvā'dhyāyakaḥ | 

asiṣṭho dṛdhiṣṭho baliṣṭhaḥ | tasyeyaṁ pṛthivi sarvā vittasya pūrṇā syāt | 

sa eko mănușa anandaḥ te ye sataṁ mānuṣā ānandāḥ || 1|| 

sa eko manuṣyagandharvāṇāmānandaḥ śrotriyasya cākāmahatasya | 

सैषाऽऽनन्दस्य मीमांसा भवति । युवा स्यात्साधुयुवाऽध्यायकः । 

आशिष्ठो दृढिष्ठो बलिष्ठः। तस्येयम् पृथिवी सर्वा वित्तस्य पूर्णा स्यात् । 

स एको मानुष आनन्दः । ते ये शतम् मानुषा आनन्दाः॥ १॥ 

स एको मनुष्यगन्धर्वाणामानन्दः । श्रोत्रियस्य चाकामहतस्य । 

"The nature and details of the bliss in mokṣa, that the jñānis surely acquire, will be described herewith. One who stays with Viṣṇu, one who has good qualities, one who has acquired the status of pūrṇa adhyayana phala, would acquire his full of bliss, that will be eternal, he will be nirvikāra and full of strength. During saMsāra, when he rules the entire Earth, full of prosperity in Tretayuga what ever bliss he gets - multiply that 100 times and that will be 1 unit of his bliss in mokṣa. Multiply that by 100 and that will be one bliss unit of Manuşya Gandharva and so on." 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The same vAkyAs appear in the Bṛhadaraṇyakopaniṣat as well. 

Siddhanta: 

strange as 

Of course it does. But that still did not help them. As it may sound, they still did not get it, despite the clear cut message in the śruti. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The major tenets of the MAdhvA VedAntA have been refuted in the Vijayindra ParAjayA. 

Siddhanta: 

Firstly, the objections to Visiṣṭādvaita are not major tenets of Madhva Vedanta. Secondly, Visiṣṭādvaita is trying to defend its position by answering the objections of 'Madhva Vedanta'. Thirdly, in that process, they are exhibiting their weak process much more emphatically. The ridiculousness of their position will be proven even more in what follows. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Khyati Vada 

The MAdhvAs, particularly Jaya TirthA, argue that Sri Ramanuja"s theory of errors is not right. Sat KhyAti, proposed by Sri Rāmānuja, states that whatever is seen is real and not an illusion. For instance, if one sees a shell and thinks it is silver, it does not mean that what he saw was an illusion. Based on the theory of quintuplication during creation, mentioned in the Upanishads, it can be said that shell possesses a few properties of silver, and hence, what was perceived is actually a bit of silver (namely, the luster of silver) in the shell. 

Siddhanta: 

Using Panchikaraṇa, Sri Shankara had set out to say that the "real world is an illusion". Now Using Panchikaraṇa, Sri Rāmānuja had set out to say that "the illusory silver is real" ? And then to substantiate such a ridiculous position, various types of statements are made which are ambiguous, uncertain and ambivalent. Statements like "It is not an illusion", "A tiny amount of silver is there in shell", "a few properties of silver are there", etc. 

Just because my shirt is green and the leaf is green, one cannot say that a tiny amount of leaf is in my shirt or a tiny bit of my shirt is in the leaf. 

Let us get to the root of their confusion and resolve it once for all. 

A physical substance has two kinds of properties 

1. Physical properties 

state (like solid, liquid, gaseous) 

density: m/v 

color: The pigment or shade 

conductivity: electricity to flow through the substance 

malleability: if a substance can be flattened 

luster: how shiny the substance looks 

Extensive: A physical property that will change if the amount of matter changes. 

mass: how much matter in the sample 

volume: How much space the sample takes up 

length: How long the sample is 

odor: the smell it gives 

2. Chemical properties 

Atomic structure, bonding, eletrons, etc that give potential for the chemical change. It is rather difficult to define chemical property without talking about change. The properties that are exhibited by reacting to other things like potential to ignite and explode or reacting to acids, etc. 

- 

Now if a tiny bit of silver is there, then thru checmical process, one should be able to extract that silver from the shell. 

There is a beautiful saying in the west "All that glitters is not gold". When the whole world knows what the truth is, it does nt make sense for some to go against that truth. 

The illusions can happen for several reasons, In most cases, it is the appearance. The identity of a substance is determined by chemical properties, but not the physical properties. The shell does not have the chemical properties of the silver. So, there is no silver at all in the shell. The cause for the illusion is similarity in appearnce. There can be examples, where a sibstance is mistaken due to similarity in the odor. 

Suppose the water is frozen into ice. The water is liquid and the ice is solid. The physical property is different, yet because the chemical properties (Hydrogen and oxygen in certain ration) are the same the ice is non-different from the water. 

If one does not have a clear concept of pratyakṣa, giving wrong theories will lead to confusion and misguide the people. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

The error is the lack of perception of the shell properties, and perceiving only a minimal property of silver in the shell. 

Siddhanta: 

That is totally wrong. Both the shell and the silver are having the same physical properties (only some, like both are solid, both have the silver color and both have silver luster/shine.) So we are 

PERCEIVING THE SHELL PROPERTIES THAT ARE EXACTLY SAME AS THE SILVER 

PROPERTIES AND SO SOME GET THE ILLUSION THAT IT IS SILVER. There is no such thing as minimal property, maximum property, etc. The commonness of some physical properties is the root cause for the illusion. 

There is difference in other physical properties like silver is ductile and malleable, where as shell is brittle. Their densities are different. Various kinds of ornaments can be made from silver. No such ornaments can be made from the shell. Their chemical properties are different. The difference in the chemical properties is what confirms that it in deed is an illusion. There are no two things about it. 

If we take the mirage, the ludicrousness hits one's face, if any one makes a claim that there is a tiny amount of water in the mirage. There is some common property between mirage and water in terms of 

appearance. 

So, let us leave the illusion as illusion and real as real, rather than making one's own unsustenable judgement.Pūrvapakṣa: 

Another example is that a person sees a boulder in the night and thinks it is a person. This error is not due to quintuplication, for we cannot say that a bit of the person was in the boulder. However, this is due to cognition of attributes in boulder that can be seen in the person, and neglecting to see the entire boulder. For instance, we see yAnamalai and say it looks like an elephant. So, there is a common property between yAnamalai and elephant, ie, the shape. Hence, something real is perceived here and nothing unreal. The error in perception is the lack of cognition of features such as the fact that the boulder is inert and not sentient, made of stone, etc. 

Siddhanta: 

Firstly any theory can not be proven with examples. Secondly, when the theory is dead wrong, the examples themselves reveal the invalidity of the theory. Thirdly, it is shocking that the believers of those wrong theories present those same ridiculous examples like a parrot, without realizing that the examples do in fact debunk their theories. 

— 

First of all quintuplication or panchikarana has nothing to do with sat khyāti at all. I dont know why a desperate attempt is made to make some connection. Also, they get dragged towards the truth "we cannot say that a bit of the person was in the boulder". Then as if there is a reluctance to see the truth, a weird statement is given "However, this is due to cognition of attributes in boulder that can be seen in the person, and neglecting to see the entire boulder." 

The cause of the illusion is the similarity of appearance. The viewer has seen lot of persons, but very rarely a person shaped boulder. Same is the case with the other example like elephant shaped boulder. In most of these examples, the root cause is the similarity in the appearnce. The supporting causes are like insufficient light, or bright light (like for shell-silver), frequency of viewing or fear or apprehenson (like rope and snake), etc. All these examples are perfect cases of illusion. Surely the shell is real, the rope is real, the stone/boulder is real. Even in case of mirage, the sand, or the road or the fields are real, the sun is real. The illusion happens only when there is similarity and when there is knowledge of things, which we mistake for (Absence of knowledge of snake, silver, person, water) will not lead to the kind of illusions mentioned. Of course absence of knowledge of the latter two is unthinkable. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Sri Rāmānuja gives the example that Putika can be used as a substitute in sacrifices if Soma is not available. This is because Putika possesses a few traits of Soma. 

Siddhanta: 

A substitute is not an illusion and not even a topic for Sat khyāti vāda. What a confusion !? It is talking about the substitute in case of unavailability of Soma. There are also instances where the substitutes may not even possess a close resemblance. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Jaya Tirtha argues stating that there is no proof that a remote causal phenomenon would cause one substance to possess quantities of the other. Shell does not contain Silver. If so, how did the person perceive the small amount of silver in shell and leave out the major portion, namely, the shell part? 

Siddhanta: 

A good question and no answer. Or rather an attempt is made, but in futile, as shown below. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Similarly, if Putika contained some proportion of Soma, why recommend Putika as a substitute, when you can use it anyway? 

Siddhanta: 

Another good question and no answer. Or rather an attempt is made, but in futile, as shown below. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The above refutation is baseless, if you can see it clearly. Jaya Tirtha does not understand that Sri Ramanuja"s position is different from what he is saying. We do not say silver, in its entirety, is present in shell. But a few attributes of silver, namely, its luster, is present in shell, and as such, we say a bit of silver, namely, its luster is present in shell. 

Siddhanta: 

The real issue is that they dont understand the basics of properties of the substances. The sugar block is white, the lime stone is white and so, will they say that a bit of limestone is in sugar block or vice versa? Cant they understand that the similarity in appearance is caused by both having same kind of luster. See above for more details. When the luster is same, it is puerile to say that "a bit of silver is present". Only small children, who do not have sufficient vocabulary will use one set of words for another set. Only a highlevelof purvāgraha makes them justify their mistake by using evenmore ridiculous arguments ike - 1% silver and 99% shell is present in the shell, but the viewer does not see and the viewer sees 

the silver even though it is 1% but does not see the shell even though it is 99% ! 

And then hand wave 

understand." 

— 

"The refutation is baseless. Jayatirtha does not 

"a bit of silver, namely, its luster" is an indication of poor vocabulary or heavy confusion or relucatnce to accept the truth.. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

This luster overwhelms the other properties of shell and causes error. It is not that a bit of silver in its entirety itself is present in shell. Swami Desikan makes it clear in Tattva Mukta Kalapa. Only the bit of silver elements responsible for lustre are present in shell. The lustre itself is an overpowering attribute in the shell, which is cognised over other properties of shell, and hence is responsible for error. 

Siddhanta: 

There is no such thing as "overwhelm". The silver-like-shell is more rare than silver. Even if it is not rare, no one carries a lab chemicals to perform a chemical test on that. If a person is seeing the shell-silver for the firts time and is quite unaware of the existence of such a shell makes the rror of mistaking it for silver. The luster makes the viewer cognize the shell as silver. Appearance is only one of the physical properties and there is illusion. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

In other cases like the yAnamalai, the quintuplication theory is not needed. It is straightforward in itself, vis., lack of cognition of some attributes. 

Siddhanta: 

A needless repetition. This example has been discussed earlier on. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

For instance, a jaundiced person sees everything as yellow. This is not because a bit of yellow is in the object, but rather, yellow bile is only perceived, and due to its preponderance, it hides the true nature of the objects. So, while a jaundiced person cognises some attributes of the object, eg: round table, he does not see other attributes, eg: white table, because he sees the yellow superimposed on the table. This results in error (yellow table). 

Siddhanta: 

The yellowness is not there in the table, but he sees the yellowness, as simple as that. Every thing that is very obvious is masked out. A lot of noise is created. The cause for perceiving the yellowness 

(like jaundice, bile) is mentioned. When he sees yellowness, he does not see whiteness, naturally. Right? How can a person see both whiteness and yellowness in the same object at the same time, when he is jaundiced? he will see only yellowness, even though it is white. The yellow tableand the white table appearing yellow have same attributes for the jaundiced person. Seeing yellowness that is not there, seeing silver that is not there, seeing water vapor that is no there are all clear-cut examples of illusion and giving the causes or giving the common properties will not mask the truth of their being illusory phenomena. 

Shake off and see the truth rather than vehemently arguing with more and more mistakes. One can come up with a billion examples, but none of them can go against the truth, simply because it just can't. That will only increase the frustration and stunt the thinking process. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

MAdhvA's theory is that a person sees unreal silver due to memory of a prior cognition (similarly, unreal yellow table instead of white table), but later on finds out it was a shell or white table. By Occam's Razor, this theory is eliminated as it makes one extra assumption about the cognition of an unreal entity. 

Siddhanta: 

One gives a gun to a child, who does not know how to use a gun and the child shoots its own foot, without the realization that it is going to hurt him only. 

Occam's razor is a principle of parsimony, economy, or succinctness used in logic and problem-solving. It states that among competing hypotheses, the hypothesis with the fewest assumptions should be selected. 

What Madhvācārya and his followers are saying in case of matters like "perception of yellow table by a jaundiced person, when it is white", is not much different from what a westerner or any person with common sense says. Even Visiṣṭādvaitins go 80% in the right direction, then they see the opposite camp and so run in a wrong direction and end up in a quagmire. 

This is pratyakṣa realm. There is zero assumption. 

1. X is jaundiced. 

2. X sees a white table. 

3. X sees it as an yellow table. 

There are two possibilities (theoretically) - X has never seen yellow in his life and has no idea how it looks like and does not know the name yellow or X knows what yellow looks like. 

4a. X thinks that it is some color, but has no clue (in the first option). 

4b. X thinks that it is an yellow table (in the second option). 

Since it is given that 4b is the case and so it is second option. 

Now their position. 

1 to 3 still hold. 

Now starts their fun and confusion. Where is yellow? It is in the bile and the effect is in his eyes. He sees yellowness in the table. Does he see yellowness? Yes he does. Is there yellowness in the table. 

V1. Yes, there is 

V2. No, there is not 

V3. There is a tiny amount of yellowness, but he sees lot of yellowness. 

V4. The yellowness in his eyes is transferred to the table. V5. May be it is not. 

V6. The superimposition of yellowness is cause by Jaundice (of course that we all accept we are not talking about the cause - the 

- 

discussion is simply 

— 

is there really yellowness in the table). talking about the cause is to divert the real staright question. 

One brings in Occam's razor. That will debunk their whole theory. 

It is a simple case of illusion. Why not accept it? 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

YathArtha KhyAti/Sat KhyAti states that whatever is perceived is real, and nothing unreal is perceived. 

Siddhanta: 

The perception is real, of course. The perceived object does not exist there. For ex, it is true that X mistook that the silver is in the shell. But there is no silver in the shell (not tiny bit). X perceived is true. X was illusioned that is real. The silver is in 

— 

the shell 

- 

that is unreal. One has to separate the wheat from the chaff. Apply the same approach in all the examples. 

In case of a person who mistook silverness in the shell has the knowledge of silver, but has no knowledge of the absence of silver in the shell. Thus anirvachanIyatva cannot be attributed and full knowledge in this respect also cannot be attributed. 

Thus this mistakenness needs both the following things 

1. Knowledge of silver and 

2. Absence of knowledge of absence of silver in the shell. 

A person (say X), who has no knowledge of silver does not mistake it. for silver. A person (say Y), who has knowledge of silver and also who has knowledge of absence of silver in the shell also does not mistake it for silver. Though both X and Y do not mistake, we say that X has no proper knowledge, where as Y has. 

Thus to understand the difference between right and wrong knowledge, a deeper analysis is needed. 

I can go on elaborating every single example. But after this much of explanation, that must be a much simpler task for the readers. 

In fact from time to time, people had raised question about this satkhyāti and also Nitya Suris. Some urls are as follows

MAdhvAs have criticized the doctrine of Nitya SUris. According to them, Adi Sesha is not a nitya suri but is a baddha jivA. Rudra will become Adi Sesha in his next birth. The pramAnA for Adi Sesha's baddha status is that BalarAmA protested the marriage of Subhadra with Arjuna, going against the Lord. This is due to ignorance, so BalarAmA is not a Nitya SUri. Plus, the following sloka from Garuda PurAnA Is quoted: " Being a Sthitha Prajna, Rudra will rise higher to the state (padam) of Sankarshana and attain Viṣṇu's abode". 

Siddhānta: 

11 

Before any position is given, one must be clear of what one means. The word "Suri" means jñāni. If they claim that there are Nityajñānis, surely there are. If they claim that Suri refers to aparokṣa jñāna and Nityasuris are nitya aparokṣajñānis, that is fine too. 

If they claim that Nitya Suris refer to Nityamukta-s and that they would like to categorize certain devatas as Nitya muktas, they have to come up with the following pramāṇa-s 

— 

1. They have to come up with the usage of the term "Nitya sūri". 

2. They have to come up with the pramāņa that says that "Nitya sūri" refers to "Nitya mukta", but not just "Nitya jñāni" or "Nitya aparokṣin". 

3. They have to come up with the pramāṇa-s that tells that "Nitya sūris" are the ones, whom they categorize as such. 

They always use the following 

- 

"OM tadviṣṇoḥ paramam padam sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ" 

ॐ तद्विष्णोः परमम् पदम् सदा पश्यन्ति सूरयः 

- 

विष्णुसूक्त ऋग्वेद 

It simply means that the jñānis always witness that supreme abode of the Lord after being graced from the Lord. 

The terms "sadā (always)" and "nitya (eternal)" are not identical. 

Suppose X says to Y "you can always use my car", it only means that as long as the car is there and usable and as long as the person is alive, he can use the car. Neither the car is permanent, nor the person is. So, how can this "always" be 

eternal? The word "always" is always used in the sense of "relative always" only. 

For ex. in Gita, pls see verse 

"yatendriyamanobuddhirmunirmoxaparāyaṇaḥ | vigatecchābhayakrodho yaḥ sada mukta eva saḥ ||" 

यतेन्द्रियमनोबुद्धिर्मुनिर्मोक्षपरायणः । 

Gitā 5-28 

विगतेच्छाभयक्रोधो यः सदा मुक्त एव सः ॥ 

Jital-4-26 गीता ५-२८ 

If one is eternally mukta, the question of controlling indriyas, mind and buddhi and desirous of obtaining mukti does not arise. 

Similarly to understand the limitation of the word "sada", pls see the verses 6-15, 6-28, 8-6, 10-17, 18-56 in Gīta. 

— 

In some rare occasions, this "nitya" is also used in a kind of relative sense. But in śāstra-s, it is specifically used to indicate eternality. 

We always have to see the context. If the nitya suris have already obtained mukti, then they should never take birth here. Except Nārāyaṇa and Lakṣmi, no other devata comes to this earth and performs the acts that are visible to others. Lakṣmi and Nārāyaṇa do not bear physical body and they have jagadvyāpāratva. The mukta jīvas do not have jagadvyāpāratva and do not perform any activity physically and visibly. 

Lord Krishna says 

"yadgatvā na nivartante taddhāma paramaM mama" यद्गत्वा न निवर्तन्ते तद्धाम परमं मम 

(Having reached that mukta sthāna, that also I own, one does not return to this Earth.). 

Why should one, who is mukta, take up this physical body again (even if it were for the sake of others) and perform any jagadvyāpāra? 

They are not nitya muktas. sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ can also simply mean "aparokṣa jñānis" (seeing the Lord in their heart). However even in case of aparokşa darśana, there is tāratamya and not always an aparokṣajñāni can see the Lord. 

The śruti can mean "limied always" and also it can be after attaining mukti. It can also just mean bimba darśana. 

Further, Laksmi says (in AmbhraNIsUkta) 

"yaṁ kāmaye tam tamugram kṛṇomi tam barhmāņam tam ṛśim tam sumedhāṁ...' 

यम् कामये तम् तमुग्रम् कृणोमि तम् बह्म॑णम् तम् ऋषिम् तम् सुमेधाम्... 

If there are nitya suris (in the sense of VA), then the question of Lakṣmi "making them into suris" does not arise. 

Thus there are too many flaws in their interpretation. 

The concept of nityamuktas is rejected by the following statement of 

Bṛhadāraṇyakopanișat ato.anyad artam (s), which says that everything other than Brahman is 'ārtaM' i.e. subject to misery. 

Even if we grant the VA interpretation, they will land up even in greater difficulties. 

Let us assume that "sada paśyanti surayaḥ" is describing Nityasuris. 

Now the next question is "who are nityasuris?". Now the fun starts. Every school can take a free ride, listing whom ever they want as Nityasuris. Now they need another pramāņa which lists the Nityasuris. It does not suffice to say that "what ever the founder says, we just take". Then nothing stops people from claiming Satyasaibaba as nityasuri or Mariamma as Nityasuri. 

When people point out the flaws in them, people take refuge in statements like "Even Rama said that he is merely son of Dasaratha", "Nityasuris can pretend that they have flaws", "Nityas and Lord can easily lie, no doubt about it". This kind of approach is dangerous, as people can claim any one they like as Nityasuri and keep on justifying such statements. 

The litmus test for deciding if a thought process is right or not is that it should not lead to bigger problems, as we advance in that path. 

So, from all the above pramāṇa-s, it is not just Garuda and seṣa are not nitya muktas, but even Chaturmukha Brahma, who is worshipped by Garuda, śeşa and Rudra, is not nitya mukta. None other than Nārāyaṇa and Lakṣmi are nitya muktas. There are of course many mukta Brahmas, many mukta Garuḍas and many mukta śeṣas. 

The pramAnA for Adi Sesha's baddha status is that BalarAmA protested the marriage of Subhadra with Arjuna, going against the Lord..." - All this is true. But VA my do some gymnastics like saying that it is all pretence, etc. But one thing that they cannot deny is that they are still in saMsāra. Nitya mukta being in saMsāra is like a cold fire or weak Paramātma, etc. Thus they face a double whammy absence of pramāṇa-s for their position, presence of pramāṇa-s that refute their position. 

Pūrvapaksa: 

MAdhvAs interpret Sankarshana as Adi Sesha and padam as position. However, I know for a fact that this verse talks about the stage of Bhakti Yoga presided by the vyUha murthy Sankarshana. Padam here denotes state and not position. It simply talks about Rudra's advancement in bhakti yoga and not about Adi Sesha. Sri Rāmānuja has equated the 4 stages of bhakti yoga with the 4 vyUha mUrtis. As such, the sankarshanA mentioned here is the vyUha murthy and not Adi Sesha. 

Siddhanta: 

This kind of explanation can not be applied. Why? Let us see the quote from Garuda purāṇa 

— 

sthitaprajño'pi yastūrdhvaḥ prāpya raudraṁ padaṁ tataḥ | sankarṣaṇam tato muktimagad viṣṇuprasādataḥ || 

स्थितप्रज्ञोऽपि यस्तूर्ध्वः प्राप्य रौद्रम् पदम् ततः । 

साङ्कर्षणम् ततो मुक्तिमगाद् विष्णुप्रसादतः ॥ 

yaḥ urdhvaḥ tu sthitaprajñaḥ api raudram padam prāpya tataḥ sankarṣaṇaṁ 

(padaṁ prapya) tato viṣṇuprasādataḥ muktim agāt | 

यः ऊर्ध्वः तु स्थितप्रज्ञः अपि रौद्रम् पदम् प्राप्य ततः साङ्कर्षणम् (पदम् प्राप्य ) ततो विष्णुप्रसादतः मुक्तिम् 

अगात् । 

Now the obvious meaning 

Even though one who is known as urdhva (He is also known as Ugratapa) is sthitaprajña (jñāni), first obtained Rudra Padavi, then Sankarṣaṇa (śeṣa) padavi and thereafter from the grace of Lord Visņu obtained mukti.When this meaning is straight forward and does not go against any pramāṇa-s, there is no need and purpose to give some round about explanation. Secondly, let us grant their wish and make an attempt to go their route. 

According to them, padam does not represent padavi, but some state of Bhakti yoga, attached to a vyuha murthy of Viṣṇu. 

So, sānkarṣaṇam padaṁ is bhakti yoga attached to vyūha murthy Sankarshana. Then what is Raudra padam ? What Bhakti yoga is it and which vyuhamūrthy is that attached to? 

They ignore the context, they ignore the purpose and they do all kind of gymnastics to support a position that is untenable. 

There is also Naradiya purāņa quote that supports this. 

"mahādeva parejanmaMstava muktirnirūpyate" 

महादेव परेजन्मंस्तव मुक्तिर्निरूप्यते 

- 

- नारदीय पुराण 

(Oh Mahadeva, after completing another janma (which is śeşa), your mukti is to take place). 

So much for knowing for a fact. pūrvāgraha will not leave so easily. It does not leave great scholars, it does not leave middle tier ones and it does not leave beginners. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

BalarAmA was an avEsa avatara of perumAl as well as an avatarA of Adi Sesha. That explains why he sometimes objected to Krishna, as the amsam of Viṣņu was just playing a leela. Dvaitins refuse to accept the concept of avEsa, but ParAsara Muni has stated in Visņu PurAnA that he himself was the VyAsA before Krishna DvaipAyana. Hence, that proves that VyAsA is not paramAtmA, but an avesa avatara. 

Siddhānta: 

Firstly there is no such thing as "aveśa avatara". That is like saying "round square" or "square circle". It is either aveśa or avatāra. āveśa means a special presence of power of the deity is there and that varies as per the need. 

Avatāra can be amśāvatāra or pūrṇāvatāra, but in case of the Lord, they will mean the same as an amśa of infinity is also infinity. That is why the shruti goes "pūrṇamadaḥ pūrṇamidam...". All avatāras of the Lord are pūrṇa. When it comes to other devatas, they don't have pūrṇaavatāra in general and as per their yogyata, the amśāvatāras take place. 

It is an ignorant statement to say that Dvaitins don't accept the concept of aveśa. Far from it, Dvaitins use the concepts about āveśa extensively as that is mentioned in śāstras. Balarama has God's āvesa and he is avatara of adi śeșa. There is no amsa, but only avesa of the Lord. aveśa does not play the Leela as that is not the purpose of the aveśa. As Garuda, seșa and Rudra are not among Paraśukla traya, there is a rare occasional behavior of that kind for a very short time. They very soon come out of that grip. 

"...was the VyAsA before Krishna DvaipAyana" is a meaningless statement as Kṛṣṇadvaipayana (He was born in Krishna dvIpa and hence that name) He is Himself Vyasa also known as VedaVyāsa. He is Himself Paramātma and not āveśa as Visiṣṭādvaita thinks. "Vyāsāya Viṣṇurūpāya Vyasarūpāya viṣṇave... 

व्यासाय विष्णुरूपाय व्यासरूपाय विष्णवे 

T 

Parāśara muni is "Vyasa". I think they got confused between "Vyasa" 

and "Vyasa". "vyasasya apatyam puman Vyasaḥ" (34 YHA TA:1). Lord Vedavyāsa incarnated as son of Vyasa. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

RAmAyaNa has a stotra by Brahma on RAMA, which states "Lying on the causal ocean, you created me eons ago". This is quoted by Sri ParAsara Bhattar in the Sahasranama Bhashyam. Hence, BhagavAn created Brahma while lying down, which is obviously on Adi Sesha. So, Adi Sesha existed before the first created entity, namely, Brahma, subject to karma. 

Padma PurAnA states that the seat is Naga ParyankA as well. 

Siddhānta: 

If the argument "Brahma was created after ādi śeșa, as he was created while the Lord was lying on adi śeşa and so ādi śeşa is nitya Suri", then as we all accept Laksmi is greater than Brahma, we will have following contention 

"Lakṣmi was created after the gods and demons during samudra mathana by those gods and demons, and so all those gods and demons are nitya Suris". Another factor is that the Visiṣṭādvaitins should not have any difficulty with this as they believe that every jiva is eligible for mukti, what is the big issue in making those gods and demons as nitya sūris !! It is one disaster after another ! 

And If seṣa was there at all times, what happens to following shruti vākya 

"vāsudevo vā idamagra āsīnna brahmā na ca sankaraḥ" 

वासुदेवो वा इदमग्र आसीन्न ब्रह्मा न च शङ्करः 

"Vasudeva was there in the very beginning; Brahma was not there, Shankara was not there." 

Some may tend to argue "Brahma and Shankara were mentioned, but not seṣa; means śeṣa was there" - but that does not hold as one must note the word "agra", meaning no one else was there. Brahma includes Brahma and Vayu and similarly Rudra includes Rudra and śeşa and Garuḍa. By kaimutya nyāya all the other gods are also implied. No one existed at that time. 

If that does not convince, one is advised to note following shruti vākyas 

eko nārāyaṇa āsīnna brahmā na ca śańkaraḥ 

sa munirbhūtvā samacintayat tata ete vyajāyanta viśvo hiraṇyagarbho'gniryamo varuṇarudrendrā | 

एको नारायण आसीन्न ब्रह्मा न च शङ्करः । 

स मुनिर्भूत्वा समचिन्तयत् तत एते व्यजायन्त । 

विश्वो हिरण्यगर्भोऽग्निर्यमो वरुणरुद्रेन्द्रा । 

eko nārāyaṇa āsīnna brahma neśāno 

एको नारायण आसीन्न ब्रह्मा नेशानो 

"Only Nārāyaṇa existed, no Brahma and no Shankara. He intended and then only Brahma, Vayu, agni, yama, Varuņa, Rudra, Indra and others were born". 

"Only Nārāyaṇa existed and no Brahma and No Rudra.". 

Note the word "eko" (He alone). 

!? 

If they think that śeşa existed at all times, what about when the Lord lies down on Banyan leaf during Pralaya. śeşa was lying somewhere during Pralaya and the Lord did not want to use seṣa ! 

Think of "vaṭapatraśāyi" (924). One can even argue "well, the Lord does not always lie down on śeșa. He also uses other things to lie down.". But the conscience and intellect must tell the context and purpose, time and occasion. Pralaya is perfect time to use ādi śeṣa if he is there. And note the above śruti vākyas Lord alone existed.

COMMENT: Does not the Nitya Suri vada indicate the jiva jiva bheda? 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

MAdhvAs state Garuda is not a Nitya Suri based on the Udyoga Parva of MAhAbhAratA which states that once Visņu taught Garuda a lesson for developing ahamkArA in being His (Viṣṇu's) VAhanA. I am guessing here that we cannot decide from smrti the status of beings. 

Siddhanta: 

What is the reason for guessing? Perhaps, a compelling desire to stick to pūrvāgraha. Mahabharata is given the status of shruti even though it is smrti. It is called Panchama veda. "mahatvāt bhāravatvācca mahābhāratamucyate" 

(महत्वात् भारवत्वाच्च महाभारतमुच्यते ) ( It is called Mahabharata because of its 

mahatva and bhāra or weight in terms of its meaning). Secondly, it does not go against any shruti vākya and there is no need to discard it. There is no shruti vākya that says that Garuda is nitya mukta. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

If so, 

we have to say Sita was a samsAri considering that she behaved like a normal queen. But even Dvaitins accept her as a nitya muktA, though not for the reasons we do. 

Siddhanta: 

- 

People cannot have their own reasons for accepting a deity as nityamukta or not. Whether it is Dvaitins or Visiṣṭādvaitins, there can be only one reason do śāstras says so or not. There is no rhyme or reason to make guess work. The matters like those, which are beyond pratyakṣa, cannot spring from the whimsical or wishful attitudes or thoughts of any individual or group. 

Secondly it is a very sad state of affairs, that they cannot differentiate between "naraloka viḍambana" and "aparādha towards the Lord". There is a category called "paraśuklatraya" (three groups of people) who never oppose the Lord either in Mula rūpa or avatāra, who never do ahamkāra pradarśana towards or in front of the Lord, who never mistake the Lord. This is pramāņa siddha. Lakṣmi by herself forms one group. Brahma, Vayu and the Rujugaņa (Rujutva is never swerving from the path of doing the right thing) form second group, their wives form the third group. 

All the others do one of those mistakes (Opposing the Lord, like what Rudra did, ahaMkāra pradarśana towards the Lord like what Garuḍa did and mistaking the Lord like what Balarama did) at some point of time. That is aparādha towards the Lord and totally different from behaving like an ordinary person. One must think as to which of these can come as a role model structure. 

"yadyadācarati śreṣṭhastattadevetaro janaḥ | sa yatpramāņaṁ kurute lokastadanuvartate || 

Gitā 

- 

3-21 

(Whatever a great person does, others emulate that. Whatever he demonstrates as authoritative, the world follows.) 

Behaving like a normal person is neither a taboo, nor a thing unworthy of emulation. Quite contrarily, Opposing the Lord or ahankAra pradarshana are both a taboo and a thing unworthy of emulation. One must not get mixed up between these two types. 

For the sake of one's own convenience, some people may ignore the Mahabharata vākya, which is panchama veda. It is akin to sacrificing a cow (the goshabda also means a śruti vākya) go-sadṛśa mahābhārata vākya to what one worships like a deity, the ideal (the idol) of pūrvāgraha. "pūrvāgrahavigrahāya mahābhāratavāggāM balimāvahanti". 

An elaborate account of Garuḍa's pride and Lord Viṣņu's mode of teaching him a lesson is given in Udyoga parva. There is no justification in ignoring that. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Sri ParAsara Bhattar quotes the suparna suktam of Veda, which states that Garuda is VedAtmA. He embodies the Veda, ie, Seshatvam. This implies omniscience. Hence, the Udyoga Parva can be dismissed as a leelA of Garuda. No other devatA is called 'VedAtmA'. 

Siddhānta: 

Sure, Garuda is abhimani devata of Veda. In fact it is even stated that the wings of Garuda emanate samaveda when he flies. He is a great deity and saying that he is not nitya mukta will not bring down his status. 

It is shocking that people have very weak understanding in these 

matters 

— 

Let me give an example there are many who believe that Lord Shival is the most Supreme deity. When one says that Lord Visņu is the most Supreme and Shiva himself will not approve attributing all-supremacy to him, then they start quoting scriptural statements describing the greatness of Shiva. Surely Shiva is great. The question is not about the specific quotes of greatness, but it is about his "all- supremacy". When one says that Shiva is not all-supreme, instantly they react "you are insulting Shiva", etc. Just as Shiva is very great, but not all-supreme, same way Garuḍa is very great, vedābhimāni, great devotee of the Lord and yet he is not nitya mukta. This is as per the scriptural statements and there is not a single statement that speaks of nitya muktatva of Garuda or śeşa or any 

Deity other than Sri Hari and Lakṣmi. Further labelling the removal of ahankara of Garuda can be labelled as Leela of Sri Hari, but not Leela of Garuda. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

The theory of Nitya Suris is supported by Sruti. 

Siddhanta: 

This has been discussed in this article above. There are two issues. First of all the shruti vākya does not tell about "nityamuktatva". Secondly, it does not speak of nityamuktatva of Garuda and seṣa. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Sri Ranga Rāmānuja Muni provides many pramAnAs in his bhashyas. 

Siddhanta: 

They will all be refuted as shruti vākyas cannot destroy one another. Sarva Upaniṣatsāra Bhagavadgita cannot and will not misguide people (yadgatvā na nivartante taddhāma paramam mama). 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Chandogya Upanishad states that the AmAnava Purushan unites us with Brahman, implying that he is a nitya suri. 

Siddhanta: 

atha yadu caivāsmiñchavyaṁ kurvanti yadi ca narciṣamevābhisambhavanti | arciso haḥ | aha āpūryamāṇapakṣam | āpūryamāṇapakṣādyan şaḍudan eti māsān tān māsebhyaḥ samvatsaram samvatsarādādityam | adityaccandramasam | candramaso vidyutam | tat puruşo'mānavaḥ sa enan brahma gamayat eşa devapatho brahmapatha etena pratipadyamānāḥ imaṁ mānavamāvartaṁ nāvartante nāvartante || 

Chandogya 4-15-5

छान्दोग्य ४-१५-५॥ 

On what basis are they saying that the word "amanava" refers to Garuḍa. First of all there are two versions - "amānava" if avagraha is taken or mānava if avagraha is not taken. In either case, it refers to Vayu deva only. This is the description of archirādi mārga. Vayu deva is the one who takes the eligible ones thru this archirādi märga. 

Even so, 

we don't call Vayu as nitya mukta. We don't call Chaturmukha Brahma as nitya mukta. This shruti has no mention of nityamuktatva. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Kaushitaki Upanishads talk about 500 apsara stris, Dwara Palakas, etc. in Sri Vaikuntam. These are not posts occupied by muktAs, but are Nitya Suris since everything the Upanishad states is anAdi. 

Siddhanta: 

Kāṭhaka Upaniṣat speaks about Nachiketa going to Yama's abode. Since Veda is anadi, did Nachiketa stay in Yama's abode from anādi? 

Veda is ananta also - that means, which ever deity is mentioned as amukta in Upanisats were never in mukti and will never go to mukti!! 

Now their conclusion is that if any one is mentioned as mukta, he/she is nitya mukta and so by the same conclusion, every one else must be nitya-amukta. 

If they did not understand the "pravahataḥ anãditva", their problems will be endless. They seemed to have no concept of "mukta and amukta vaikuṇṭha" as well. Otherwise the incident of Jaya and Vijaya coming down to earth by the curse of Sanakādi kumāras will go against "yadgatvā na nivartante taddhāma paramam mama". 

यद्गत्वा न निवर्तन्ते तद्धाम परमम् मम। 

The apsarastris and dwarapalakas could have been in amukta vaikuṇṭha or if they are in mukta vaikuntha, then they must have reached there only after completing their sadhana and so not nitya-muktas. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

It is only in leelA vibhuti that we have posts like BrahmA, SivA, etc. which are occupied by different jivAs during different yugAs. 

Siddhanta: 

Irrespective of what Leela Vibhuti there are talking about and what posts they are talking about, the very basics are missing in VA argument. 

There are two kinds of sattvika mukta/mukti yogya jivas muktas and amuktas. 

Among muktas, Lord Viṣṇu is svatantra nitya mukta and Lakṣmi is Hari- adhIna nityamukta. All the other muktas were amuktas at some point of time and from the grace of the Lord obtained mukti at some point of time. After reaching mukti, there is no question of rebirth as the 

prakṛti-bandha is gone. Laksmi is cetana prakṛti and she controls Jada parkṛti by the grace of the Lord and hence Jada prakṛti has no influence on Sri Hari and Laksmi. So, they operate in both mukta world and amukta world (Without Sri Hari's Ichchha tṛṇamapai na chalati. Lakṣmi is 'samana' meaning she has same pervasion of the Lord deshataḥ and kalataḥ meaning at all times and in all places she accompanies the Lord). The mukta jīvas are free from prakṛti bandha and they don't operate in amukta world. Since they have no prakṛti bandha, they never do the any of the following 3 mistakes 

— 

- 

1. Opposing the Lord either in Mula rūpa or avatāra 

2. Doing ahamkāra pradarśana towards or in front of the Lord 3. Mistaking the Lord. 

Among the devatas, that are seen in amukta world, only three categories of people also qualify for not doing any of the above three errors at any time (avatāra or mularūpa) 

1. Lakṣmi (who is nityamukta), 

2. Brahma and Vayu (and the other jīvas in Rujugana, who are eligible to become Brahma) 

3. Their wives (Sarasvathi and Bharati and the other Ruju patnis). 

Hence the above are known as paraśuklatraya. 

- 

If a question arises, whether there are mukta Garuḍas and Mukta śeṣa- s, certainly there are. In fact there are infinite number of mukta Brahmas, Mukta, Garuḍas, Mukta śeṣa-s, etc. and only one amukta Brahma, one amukta seṣa, amukta Garuda, etc. at any given point of time (like present instant). When they go to mukti, the next in line will come to that position. 

The Mahabharata incident about Garuda is not just to indicate that Garuda is not nitya mukta. Similarly Balarāma incident is not just to indicate that śeşa is not nitya mukta. Those incidents indicate that they are not among Paraśuklatraya. So, by kaimutya nyāya, they are not nitya mukta-s. Note the following 

A Jiva is nitya mukta implies that the Jiva has to be one in Paraśukla traya 

A Jiva is in Paraśukla traya need not imply that the Jiva is nitya mukta. 

Despite being in Parashklatraya, Brahma and other Rujus and their wives are not considered as nitya muktas, even though they have one characteristic of Muktas namely not doing any of the above mentioned three negative points. 

All this in no way undermines the abilities and powers of Garuda and śeṣa. They are enormously great jivas, who are above Indra, kāma and even the ṣaṇmahiṣis (the six wives of Sri Krishna 

those among 

AṣṭamahiShis, excluding Rukmini and Satyabhama). Nārāyaṇa and Lakṣmi alone are nitya mukta-s. Every one else has kṣara body at some point of time and so not nitya muktas. No exceptions. In fact all these great jīvas starting from Brahma - their being in saMsāra helps many mukti yogya jivas. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

Other Issues 

- 

Some MAdhvAs argue that Swami Rāmānuja did not provide a sufficient proof for Narayana paratvam as compared to Madhva, and that he did not elaborate on the role of Sri properly. These petty complaints are of no value. I have read their arguments, and they are simply misunderstandings rather than refutations. No need to go into detail. 

Siddhanta: 

Vague statements or random statements are worth ignoring. Who argued and what is the basis of the argument? Unless the specifics are known, this issue can not be addressed. 

Pūrvapakṣa: 

VyAsa TirthA has attempted to refute the 'equality' of JivA with Brahman in the NyAyamrtA. He criticises the vishishtadvaitic interpretation of paramam sAmyam sruti. This has already been refuted. There is no equality in mokşa between jivA and paramAtmA. Sri ParakAla Yati mentiones clearly in the vijayindra parAjaya that all jivAs are under the control of Brahman. 

Siddhanta: 

This is what is called self-contradiction. 

Compare the above comment with an earlier comment viz · 

Quote:

The paramam sAmyam sruti states that JivA becomes equal in 6 gunas with Brahman. jñānA and AnandA, as explained here, are two. The JIvA is also Satya Sankalpan, since he only wants to serve Brahman, and Brahman is also Satya Sankalpan, since he has taken a vow to protect JivAs. The JivA is also Satya KAman, since all his desires are fulfilled by Brahman. The desire is merely kainkaryam and anubhavam of BhagavAn. Brahman is, naturally, Satya KAman. The JivA is also decorated with BrahmAlankAram, as described by the Kaushitaki Upanishad, hence, this is another sAmyam. Note that in all cases, the jivA does not achieve anything by his own will or effort. Everything is given by Brahman to the jivA, making the jivA totally dependent on 

Brahman. Hence, no sAmyam in 'status' as alleged by MAdhvAs. Unquote. 

What a flip-flop between 'equal' and 'not equal' !! What a confusion !! On one side, they are saying "JivA becomes equal in 6 gunas with Brahman" and again they say "Everything is given by Brahman to the jivA, making the jivA totally dependent on Brahman. Hence, no sAmyam in 'status' as alleged by MAdhvAs." Thus the above passage itself says both ways. And then the first part above contradicts with what is said in opposing Sri Vyasatīrtha. 

The rest of the points again lack any specifics and are very vaguely placed. Unless the specifics are known, those issues can not be addressed. 

One must note that the Dvaita tradition does not oppose every principle of every religion. It opposes only the points that are against scriptures and against pratyakṣa and against anumāna (not dry logic, but logic in accordance to Pratyakṣa and agama). Sri Kanakadāsaru has not sung any thing that is against shaastra. So claiming his allegiance to Visiṣṭādvaita all thru is a wasted effort. It is possible that he was Visiṣṭādvaitin and later was changed over to Dvaita (just like Trivikrama paṇḍitācārya changing from Advaita to Dvaita).Final Conclusion 

The following are some of the issues that Visiṣṭādvaita has with scriptures. A brief reason is also given as to why it is against the scriptures. Some of them have been discussed in depth inside this article. 

1. Pūrvapakṣa (The position of VA) Ananda samya or equality of eternal bliss. All the Jivas that go to mokSha get the same amount of bliss as the Lord Himself. 

The eternally 

Siddhanta (The true message from the scriptures): dependent, relatively insignificant jīva can not have the same bliss as the Lord. 

The logical inconsistencies can be seen if we realize that the Lord, who has to go thru the rigmarole of creation, sustenance, annihilation of the universe and controlling all the jivas, giving knowledge, ignorance, bondage and liberation to all the jivas gets the same bliss as that of any insignificant jīva, who does not have to do any of these. Of course the Lord does all that effortlessly as Lila; even then. Imagine a person, who works all the time (and he may do it very easily) gets paid a million dollars and another person does nothing and also gets paid a million dollars. One tends to think that the latter is even better off than the former. 

- 

What is worse as per them even the ones who hate the Lord all the time get mukti and they also get the same amount of bliss as the Lord - is that not strange ? 

2. Pūrvapakṣa (The position of VA): Satkhyāti vāda or assertion of presence of a small amount of apparent thing. 

Siddhānta (The true message from the scriptures): The root cause for their confusion is getting mixed up between visual similarity and existence of actual thing itself. They think that some mistake a silver colored shell to silver itself because a small amount of silver is in the shell. The cause for the illusion is not because a small amount is there, but because there is visual resemblance. The absurdity of their argument can easily be seen this way. If a tiny miniscule amount of silver can become the cause for illusion, then a substance known to have lot of sliver must definitely become the cause for illusion and must have much higher resemblance. The product silver oxide, which actually contains silver, does not resemble silver at all. It is dark brown. So, it is a misguided notion that a small amount of presence is needed for resemblance or a resemblance indicates a small amount of the substance being there. A mirage does not contain small amount of water. 

3. Pūrvapakṣa (The position of VA): Accepting that Garuda, śeşa, 

Visvaksena, et al are nityasuris or nityamuktas. 

Siddhanta (The true message from the scriptures): By using the śruti vākya "OM tadviṣṇoḥ paramam padam sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ" 

ॐ तद्विष्णोः परमम् पदम् सदा पश्यन्ति सूरयः 

- विष्णुसूक्त ऋग्वेद 

they try to make all kinds of conclusions. It has been shown in the main body of this write-up as to how that position leads to many difficulties. 

Even the above quote does not indicate that nityasūris refers to nityamuktas. There are no śruti vākyas or smṛti vākyas that indicate who the nityasūris are. 

Nityamuktas being in saMsāra with sthūladeha goes against pramāṇa-s. 

4. Pūrvapakṣa (The position of VA): Every sentient being has what is 

called dharma-bhūta-jñāna. Since the dharma bhūta jñānA is expanded infinitely for all Jīvas in mokṣa, there is equal cognition of Brahman"s kalyAna gunAs for all, and hence, equal enjoyment, implying also that all JivAs are identical in SvarUpA. 

Siddhanta (The true message from the scriptures): Is it 

svarūpajñāna? According to them - no. Is it vṛtti jñāna? According to them no. Then what is it? 

- 

It is defined with some characteristics of svarūpajñāna, some characteristics of vṛtti jñāna and vagueness is brought in with examples to describe it. It is like prakasha. It is like something that flows in. It is like some thing that flows out. Jñāna can increase or decrease. But instead of saying increase or decrease, they say "contract or expand". What is its purpose some how justify "Ananda samya"? To support one untenable position, another anti- scriptural and illogical concept is brought in. The continuation of DBJ into mokşa is not only unsupported, but it goes against scriptures. "na pretya samjñā asti" (Nothing other than svarupajñāna, is carried to mokṣa). 

- 

5. Pūrvapakṣa (The position of VA) Archa avatāra : The icons or idols are incarnation of the Lord. On one side, they claim that the idols are suddha sattva. That means they are still jada. Also they claim that they are incarnation of Paramatma. 

Siddhānta (The true message from the scriptures): 

How can they be jaḍa (śuddha sattva)) and Lord's incarnation at the same time? Also before the sculptor made it, was it suddha sattva or it becomes śuddha sattva later on? Again an untenable position. This was discussed in detail inside this article. 

6. Pūrvapaksa (The position of VA) śarīra śarīri bhāva : They 

- 

claim that just as the soul is inside a body and controls body, the Lord is present in all and so all the sentient and non-sentient entities are Lord's body. 

Siddhanta (The true message from the scriptures): 

Just because one is inside a thing and controls a thing, it does not have to be the body of the person. For one who is inside a car and drives a car, the car does not become the body of the person. Also, according to them, the Jiva is Lord's body and the body of the jiva is also Lord's body. 

Also if the universe is Lord's body, when Pralaya happens, the universe is annihilated. So, God has dehanāsha. So, he becomes kṣara!! Also as the universe undergoes transformation, we have to say that the Lord's body is mutated. 

7. Pūrvapaksa (The position of VA): 

Even dvesha can lead to mukti, if one hates the Lord all the time. 

Siddhanta (The true message from the scriptures): 

The faulty understanding results from the notion that a person that hates God always is thinking about God always and so gets mukti or liberation. This leads to enormous difficulties. Since according to them all muktas have same Ananda as the Lord, those enormous dveshis will have a bliss that equals to that of the Lord!! 

Further this will lead to another logical problem. If the great sinner, because of his hatred or the Lord all the time effectively thinking of the Lord all the time and so gets great punya and goes to mokşa, then by the same principle, all the smaller sinners acquire smaller punya get entitled to go to the heaven. So, no one ever goes to the hell or naraka. The great sinners and the great devotees go to mokṣa and the smaller sinners and smaller devotees go to the heaven. So the Lord of Naraka, Yama Dharmaraja is basically out of commission!! 

8. Pūrvapakṣa (The position of VA) : 

Prapatti alone is sufficient and leads to mukti. 

Siddhānta (The true message from the scriptures): 

While it is undeniable that Prapatti is very important and forms as an important ingredient of knowledge filled devotion, one must be aware that Prapatti or surrender to God cannot form an independent means to reach mukti. One of the major pitfalls they faced is in the wrong understanding of the verse in Gita 

"sarvadharmān parityajya māmekam śaraṇam vraja | aham tvā sarvapapebhyo mokṣayiśyāmi ma śuca ||" 

सर्वधर्मान् परित्यज्य मामेकम् शरणम् व्रज । 

अहम् त्वा सर्वपपेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुच ॥ 

Gitā 18-66 

गीता - १८-६६ 

The superficial meaning "Forsaking all dharmas, just surrender to me. I will liberate you from all the sins and so do not grieve.". 

• 

If that were true, then Sri Krishna preaching entire Gita becomes futile. Lord Krishna preached Yuddhadharma to Arjuna in all the 18 chapters and why would he say at that point "forget about all the dharmas"? It is like saying "Forget about what all I taught". 

Saying "One does not have to follow any dharmas and surrendering to the Lord is sufficient" is not consistent with any śastra, leave alone Gita. 

The true purport is thus. It can be viewed in two ways 

a. sarvadharman = anya sarvadharmān 

— 

This means "Forsaking all dharmas of others". One has to follow the dharmas that are natural to oneself and not the dharmas of others. One can appreciate this interpretation by seeing the verses 45-48 in chapter 18 of Gita itself. The verse from Gita says 

"sahajam karma kaunteya sadoṣamapi na tyajet" 18-48 

सहजम् कर्म कौन्तेय सदोषमपि न त्यजेत् 

This is emphasizing not to give up "sahajakarma". 

b. dharmatyāgaḥ 

= 

phalatyāgaḥ 

karmaphalatyagi is known as tyagi 

- गीता - १८-४८ 

- 

Gītā 

— 

This is evident from the words of Sri Krishna Himself and has been told in verse 2 of the same chapter 18. 

"sarvakarmaphalatyāgaṁ prāhustyāgaṁ vicakṣaṇāḥ" 

सर्वकर्मफलत्यागम् प्राहुस्त्यागम् विचक्षणाः 

— 

Gītā 

- 

18-2 

- 

- गीता - १८-२ 

This means that one has to give up all the desire for the fruits of the action and perform all actions with the understanding that Lord owns it all. What one must have is "rakṣatītyeva viśvāsaḥ tadiyo 'hamiti smrtiḥ" 

रक्षतीत्येव विश्वासः तदियोऽहमिति स्मृतिः 

(Firm belief that the Lord will protect and the awareness that I belong to Him), by giving up all the anyadharmas and the desire for the fruits of the action. 

9. Pūrvapakṣa (The position of VA): 

Some of the incarnations as apurņa avatāra (like Paraśurāma). 

Siddhanta (The true message from the scriptures): 

Lord is infinite. A fraction of infinity is also infinity. Lord is infinite and complete in all His forms. The famous śruti vākya 

(śāntimantra) 

"pūrṇamadaḥ pūrṇamidam pūrṇātpurṇamudacyate | 

pūrṇasya pūrṇamādāya pūrṇamevāvaśiṣyate ||" 

पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदम् पूर्णात्पूर्णमुदच्यते । 

quite quitıqla quiHalakœà|| 

"Lord's Mula rupa is infinite and complete. Lord's incarnation is infinite and complete. It has to be told that the infinite and complete incarnation springs from the Mularupa. Even though the complete and infinite form comes out of the Mularupa, the Mularupa remains as infinite and complete (without any diminution." 

10. Purvapakṣa (The position of VA): 

Lord is both nimitta kāraṇa and upādāna kāraṇa of the universe. 

Siddhānta (The true message from the scriptures): 

Nimitta kāraṇa is efficient cause like the pot-maker in case of a pot. Upādāna kāraṇa is material cause like the mud in case of a pot. 

They are swept by the premonition that just like the dependence of pot-maker on mud for making pot, the Lord will have to be dependent on some other matter for making the universe and so that will attribute flaw to the Lord. 

There is no need for such premonition. It is said in Bhagavata 

"dravyam karma cha kālaśca svabhāvo jīva eva ca yadanugrahataḥ santi na santi yadupekṣayā" 

द्रव्यम् कर्म च कालश्च स्वभावो जीव एव च। 

यदनुग्रहतः सन्ति न सन्ति यदुपेक्षया ॥ 

- 

Bhāgavata 2-10-12 

भागवत - २ - १०-१२ 

"The matter, the action, the time, the svabhāva exist due to His grace and cease to exist if the Lord is indifferent to them.: 

The pot-maker is not antaryāmi rupa of the mud, but the Lord is antaryāmi of all. 

11. Pūrvapakṣa (The position of VA): 

No such thing as andham tamas. No Jiva goes to andham tamas. All the Jivas eventually go to moksha and enjoy the bliss equal to that of the Lord. 

Siddhanta (The true message from the scriptures): 

This is against all the pramāņas. 

The statement from Iśāvasyopaniṣat says 

"andham tamaḥ pravishanti ye avidyāmupāsate." 

अन्धम् तमः प्रविशन्ति ये अविद्यामुपासते। 

ईशावास्योपनिषत् 

(Those who upasana of avidya reach andham tamas (the deepest of the hells) 

Lord Krishna says in Bhagavadgita 

— 

āsurīṁ yonimāpannā mūḍhā janmani janmani | 

māmaprāpyaiva kaunteya tato yāntyadhamāṁ gatim || 

आसुरीम् योनिमापन्ना मूढा जन्मनि जन्मनि । 

मामप्राप्यैव कौन्तेय ततो यान्त्यधमाम् गतिम् ॥ गीता - १६ - २० 

Gitā 

- 

16-20 

"Oh Kaunteya, these wretched people, having been born in demonical wombs, without reaching me, there after obtain deepest of the hells." 

12. Pūrvapaksa (The position of VA): 

There is no jIva traividhya. 

Siddhanta (The true message from the scriptures): 

They will have to effectively reject many Gita statements. 

trividha bhavati śraddha dehinām sā svabhāvajā | sättvikī rājasi caiva tāmasi ceti tām śrņu || 

Gītā 

- 

17-2 

त्रिविधा भवति श्रद्धा देहिनाम् सा स्वभावजा । 

सात्त्विकी राजसी चैव तामसी चेति ताम् शृणु ॥ 

गीता - १७-२ 

Three kinds of faith for the Jivas is mentioned above. By saying svabhāvajā, it has been emphasized that it is inherent. 

Further several references in Gita about sättvika, rājasika and tāmasika behaviors, outlooks, etc. 

13. Pūrvapakṣa (The position of VA): 

There is no Taratamya. 

Siddhānta (The true message from the scriptures): 

They reject tāratamya both in saMsāra and mukti. There is a strange thing here. There are explicit statements in śruti that emphasize tāratamya in mukti. First they claim that those statements pertain to saMsāra. That means they are accepting tāratamya in saMsāra. Further it has been shown in this article that there are clear terms that indicate that these tāratamya statements refer to mukti. If there is tāratamya in mukti itself, then by kaimutya nyaya (what to speak of) there is tāratamya in saMsāra. 

14. Pūrvapakṣa (The position of VA): 

They do not accept nityatva, sarvagatva and dravyatva of varṇātmaka sabda. 

Siddhanta (The true message from the scriptures): 

Vedas have varṇātmaka śabda-s. If one accepts that Vedas are nitya and sarvagata, then that automatically implies nityatva and sarvagatva of varṇātmaka śabda. 

Coming to their dravyatva, even according to modern science, sound is a form of energy. Mass Energy Equivalence can be seen in the following url's. Of course, there is a huge number of sites which discuss this. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass-energy_equivalence 

http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equivME/ 

http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast123/lectures/lec09.html 

So shabda is a kind of mass or matter. It is interesting that even before the advent of the modern science, our ancestors knew this. 

15. Pūrvapakṣa (The position of VA): 

They do not accept viseṣa. 

Siddhānta (The true message from the scriptures): 

This has been discussed extensively inside this article. 

In case of cetana, everything that is inherent of cetana is non- different from cetana as that cetana is "acchedya (Note the Gita verse)" and the qualities are all "yāvaddravyabhāvi" (lasts as long as the object lasts) only, otherwise, one will be forced to attribute vikāra for cetana. It is quite well-known that during saMsāra avastha, the abhivyakti will not be there. So, for cetanas, the qualities will be non-different from the cetana. 

That is why for Brahman, one may say "Brahman is jñāna and Ananda" or "Brahman has jñāna and Ananda". Both are correct. 

- 

In case of jada, the attributes are of two kinds "yāvaddravyabhāvi" (lasts as long as the object lasts) and "ayāvaddravyabhāvi" (does not last as long as the object lats). In case of "yāvaddravyabhāvi", there is non-difference. In case of "ayāvaddravyabhāvi", there is both difference and non-difference difference in one aspect and non-difference in another. In case of such attributes, those attributes may have been lost either naturally or through manual intervention. 

16. Pūrvapaksa (The position of VA): 

They do not accept Vayu jIvottamatva. 

Siddhānta (The true message from the scriptures): 

— 

The Upanishads are unanimous in describing Vayu jIvottamatva extensively. He is called "Akhaņṇāśma" (like an unbreakable rock). Just for s sample the following is given from Chandogya Upanishad.

(When devas and asuras, children of Kashyapa Prajapati, set out for war, devas thought that from God's grace, they can conquer asuras and began worshipping Udgitha named Lord to fulfill their wish. First they worshipped Udgitha in Nāsikya vāyu. Knowing this, the asuras infested Näsikya prāņa with sins. Hence the Jivas smell both fragrance and foul smell. Then they meditated upon Udgitha in vāk (Agni is abhimani for vāk). The asuras infested vāk (speech) with evil/sin. Hence one speaks both truth and falsehood. Then same happened with eyes (Sun god). They infested eyes too. Hence one sees seeable (proper) and unseeable (improper). Then same thing happened with ears (Abhimani Chandra). Hence we hear both good and evil. Same thing happened with mind (Rudra abhimani), Ahankara (śeşa abhimani) and Chitta (Garuḍa abhimāni). Hence we think of good and evil. Then the devas meditated Udgitha in Mukhyaprāșa. When the asuras tried to attack, afflict and infest Mukhyaprāṇa, they themselves got afflicted and infested like the mud balls hitting the strong stone get powdered. If any one does this kind of Upasana of "Akhaṇāśma", the evil forces trying to attack such a person will also get destroyed. The worshipper of Mukhyaprāņa and the Almighty God in Him, will have the good like fragrance only, but not evils like foul smell. Mukhyaprāṇa protects other gods also thru what ever the person eats and drinks. The devotee realizes that Vishnu is all Supreme and gets liberated.) 

The extolling of Mukhyaprāṇa continues. 

Again much further down it is said - 

yo ha vai jyeṣṭham ca śreṣṭham ca veda jyeṣṭhaśca ha vai 

śreṣṭhaśca bhavati prāņo vāva jyeṣṭhaśca śreṣṭhaśca || Chandogya

छान्दोग्य - ५-१-१ 

— 

5-1-1(one who realizes that Mukhyaprāṇa is jyeṣṭha ans śreṣṭha among all the gods, will get liberated and gets jyeṣṭhatva and shresthatva among his peers.) 

Similar glorification can be seen in other upaniṣads as well. Even the small Upanishat like Iśāvasyopanișat extolls Mukhyaprāṇa in the names like 

"Mātariśvā", "Vayu", "Anila", 

"Vayu", "Anila", "Amṛta". 

17. Pūrvapaksa (The position of VA): 

They do not accept Vedavyāsa as incarnation of God. 

Siddhānta (The true message from the scriptures): 

Vedavyāsa is indeed the full incarnation of Viṣņu. Lord Krishna mentioned that in Gita - vedantakṛdvedavideva caham 

Here vedanta is Brahmasutras. Lord is composer of Vedanta (Brahmasutras) and known thru vedas only. Lord Vedavyāsa composed Brahmasutras. He is mentioned as Avatara of Viṣņu in Bhāgavata also. 

18. Pūrvapakṣa (The position of VA): 

They don't accept Pancha bheda (or five-fold difference) 

Siddhānta (The true message from the scriptures): 

This is both pratyakṣasiddha and Agamasiddha. No difference can be denied here. This has been discussed in detail inside this article.
