Shri Kesava Rao Tadipatri   
viśistādvaita viślesana vivecanam   

## Introduction   
At the very outset, I would like to point out that have great admiration for Sri Rāmānuja that when the ever confusing points of Advaita were ruling, he made tremendous progress in pointing out the many flaws in there, by founding Viśiṣṭādvaita. However due to the will of the Lord some of the newer concepts introduced themselves are not aligned with shashtras.   

Sri Madhvācārya, in aligning his philosophy with the shashtras, pointed out the many shortcomings of previous philosophies and reintroduced earlier known concepts and solidified Tattvavada and set it on a firm foundation later built upon by the luminaries of his tradition. More importantly, he also foresaw the advent of people with future philosophies such as that of the Gaudiya sampradaya for example and preempted them by giving their statements as Pūrvapakṣa (Objections) and refuting them with statements of Siddhānta (Resolution) well in advance.   

Even an insignificant being like me can see and point out some of the deficiencies in other philosophies, but that is based on the wonderful works of Sri Madhvācārya and his glorious parampara. So, an effective rebuttal of Sri Parakāla yati was accomplished by Acharya Madhva and the Guru parampara and I am only pointing out those points.   

## Advaita similarity
Perhaps most ironical to see is that based on the purvapaksha statements on the following write up, Viśiṣṭādvaita does not believe in viśeṣa, while having that in the name itself! Visiṣṭa advaita or qualified Monism is perhaps true to its name. Viseṣa is bheda vyavahāra when abheda is there - that is speaking of difference when there is no difference. Visiṣṭādvaita opposes Advaita, but what Advaita accomplishes by vyāvahārikatva and Upadhi and Māyāvāda, all that is accomplished by one entity called धर्मभूतज्ञान . “dharma-bhūta-jñāna” .   

1. Advaita says that the jīva and Brahman are same or non- different in the sense that they are identified as one.   
Viśiṣṭādvaita says that the jīva and Brahman are same or non- different in the sense that they are equal.   

2. Advaita says that they appear to be different because of vyāvahārika satya of jagat - that is before liberation.   
Viśiṣṭādvaita says that they appear to be unequal because of DBJ not expanding to infinity that is before liberation.   
-   
3. Advaita says that when vyāvahārikatva melts away and when ajñāna goes away and when jñāna dawns, the jīva is identified as one same as Brahman. This happens in mokṣa or paramārtha.   
Viśiṣṭādvaita says that when dharma bhuta jnana expands to infinity, the jīva becomes equal to Brahman. This happens in mokṣa.   
4. Advaita says that the jīva needs the grace of the Lord in vyāvahārikatva, but in mokṣa, the jīva is the God.   
Visiṣṭādvaita says that the jīva needs the grace of the Lord for making its dharma bhuta jnana expand infinitely in mokṣa, where the jiva has six qualities like jñāna and Ananda equal to God.   
The purpose of this write-up is to call a spade a spade and respond to the purvapaxins point by point.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
However, the dvaitins in later times were not so friendly towards Viśiṣṭādvaita. Beginning from Jaya Tirtha, dvaita launched a number of attacks on Visiṣṭādvaita, attempting to refute our tradition.   
Siddhānta:   
This person writes elsewhere in glorifying Viśiṣṭādvaita ·   
Quote:   
—   
Swami Rāmānuja showed how the teachings of other darśanas were invalid, and that Visiṣṭādvaita was the true import of the Veda. In this respect, our Swami had numerous advantages over the founders of other darśanams, such as Advaita.   
Unquote:   
Based on the former statement, does the latter statement mean that Viśiṣṭādvaitins are not friendly towards the followers of other darśanas? Does this also mean that beginning from Swami Rāmānuja himself, Visiṣṭādvaita launched a number of attacks on other darśanas, attempting to refute their tradition?   
Isn't the root cause of all this a mix-up between a person and a thought, a darśana and a dārśanika, a philosophy and a philosopher, a tradition and a follower of that tradition, a school and a follower/founder of that school?   
If I disagree with a thought of a particular person, it is not tantamount to attacking that person. If one dārśanika sets out to disprove a point of a particular darśana, it is not tantamount to attacking the founder/follower of that darśana. Disagreement with   
some points of another philosophy is not a personal attack of the founder/follower of that philosophy. Refuting some points of a school should not be construed as an attack on the followers of that school.   
The establishment of a theory is not complete without answering the objections of the others. It has to be done at the philosophy level and not at the personal level. It is therefore incorrect to this as attacks.   
In fact there is a class of people, who want to respect every school and every class with a view that "all are correct in their own way; why indulge in any arguments; that will only lead to hatred and disharmony; the universal brotherhood can be achieved by accepting all the schools."   
There are others who think that the elasticity of Sanskrit language is the root cause for multiple schools, all of which are based on Vedic sources and brahmamīmāMsa/brahmasūtras. So, how can any one philosophy claim that it alone is accurate in every respect? Some aspects are accurate in some philosophies and each philosophy has something to offer and no philosophy has every thing to offer.   
Both of the above are not tenable positions. The latter is perhaps more confusing than the former. Which points are to be taken from which philosophy and what are the reasons behind each of those? It boils down to personal likes and dislikes of each individual and prone to changes based on the changing likes and dislkes of that individual thus making the philosophical journey an aimless one.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
The followers of Dvaita are also dualists, who believe in the reality of Sriman Narayana as saguna brahmam...   
Siddhānta:   
Just a clarification. The term dualist is meant to believe in the difference between jīva and Paramātma, but not to believe in two Brahmas – saguņa Brahma and nirguņa Brahma. There is only one Brahma. The word guņa has multiple meanings. The same Brahma is sometimes referred as saguņa and sometimes as nirguņa. When the word saguna is used, guņa means "auspicious quality". So, saguņa means One who has all the auspicious qualities. When the word nirguṇa is used, guṇa means "prākṛtika guṇa (gross quality)". So, nirguņa means One who is devoid of any "prākṛtika guņa (gross quality)". He is nirdoṣa jñāna ānandātmaka (flawless personification of knowledge and bliss).   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Dvaitins on the net have been vigorously asserting that they have 'vanquished' Visiṣṭādvaita (refer the official Dvaita website), and have compiled refutations of our tradition on their sites. The famous Dvaitin 'catchphrase' is that 21 bhashyas have been refuted by them, and they include EmperumAnAr's Sri Bhashyam in that. Now, we need not invite debates, but when we are challenged, it is but proper that we come up with a suitable response. There is a dearth of articles on Dvaita as pUrvapaksha in Sri Vaishnava sites. We can remedy this. The other reason is that we need to popularize the great mahAns who have toiled to refute the Dvaita Siddhantha, and have authored great works.   
Siddhānta:   
We have discussed earlier that refutations of philosophies has been on-going across the time horizon. And the purvapaksin points out that such has been on-going between the vishitadvaita and dvaita traditions as well from both sides.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Another primary motivation for this article is the fact that many Dvaitin scholars are not above personal insults and sometimes speak derogatory things about our great acharyas. While we shall not indulge in such mudslinging (I have the utmost respect for Madhva), it is necessary to counter this.   
Siddhānta:   
There is no second opinion that one must avoid derogatory remarks about acharyas of other schools, mudslinging of any kind and personal attacks of any kind in establishing a school or answering a set of objections. Such acts might show up in email chains, but scholarly works, meant to establish a philosophical position normally do not do that. See the works of Sri Jayatīrtha, Sri Vyāsatīrtha and Sri Vijayīndra. They did not do any of those. Even the most recent scholars, who wrote commentaries (Sri Satyadhyānatīrtharu) never did any of those. I will be curious if any one points to any commentary that has such derogatory remarks.   
A sabha (Assembly), called Shri Vedānta Vimarśini, was conducted in the auspices of Sri Satyadhyānatīrtha in Sītāvilāsachatra of Mysore, which was attended by scholars from various schools. Some of the material for "sabhāsāra sangraha" was supplied by Sri V.N.   
Desikacharya. All the questions from all the schools were answered by Sri Satyadhyānatirtha.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Pancha Bheda Tattva   
The followers of Dvaita Vedanta believe in the doctrine of pancha bheda, namely:   
1) Difference between Isvara and Jivas.   
2) Difference between Isvara and Prakrti.   
3) Difference between Jivas and Prakrti.   
4) Difference between one piece of matter and another.   
5) Difference between individual jivas.   
This is the corner stone of their school, and they supplement it with ample pramAnAs. Let us look at the two most important points, namely, 1) and 5).   
Siddhānta:   
It is not just Dvaita, indirectly Viśiṣṭādvaita also is forced to accept this. There is no escape for them. Why? Very simple. With their understanding that jīva is the śarīra of Iśvara and that Iśvara is aware of the difference between Him and his sarīra, there is difference between Iśvara and jīvas. Iśvara and jīvas are sentient and prakṛti is jaḍa or inert and so they must accept 2) and 3). They must be accepting 4) as well as there is difference between one jaḍa and another no matter how similar they are. The difference between individual jīvas is our anubhava and I am sure that they will not seek identity between their jīvas and the jīvas of their gurus. When they are forced to accept all these, why are they trying to raise objections against these? If the objections are not for these points, then why bring these as objectionable points?   
So their approach of "corner stone" business itself is misplaced. From further arguments, it seems that their objections are placed somewhere else.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Bimba-Pratibimba   
The MAdhvAs explain that IsvarA is completely independent and each Jiva is dependent. However, rather than adopting the SarirAtma bhava for explaining the difference, they postulate a theory called Bimba- Pratibimba vada. According to this theory, the jivAs are as dependent on Sri Hari as the image in a mirror is dependent on the real object. In this way, each Jiva exists solely due to Sriman Narayana, just as an image does not exist without the object. Furthermore, just as an image in a mirror does not possess all the qualities of the object, the JIvA does not possess all qualities of IsvarA, but are inferior   
in all respects.   
(Eg. A mirror reflection looks like the real object, but cannot do the things that the object does. This should provide an indication of how inferior the JIvAs are, compared to paramAtmA).   
The pramāṇa-s given for this theory by MAdhvA, are Sruti statements such as the one below:   
Katopanishad (2-2-9): agnir-yathaiko bhuvanam pratish To rUpam rUpam pratirupo babhUva /   
ekastathA sarva-bhūtantarAtmA rUpam rUpam pratirUpo bahiSca   
Just as fire, though one, having entered the world, assumes separate forms in respect of different shapes, similarly, the Self inside all beings, though one assumes a form in respect of each shape; and yet, it is outside   
A few Gita slokas are also given in support of this view.   
Curiously, these pramAnAs, according to Vishishtadvaitins, talk about the SharIrAtmabhava. For instance, the KatOpanishad vAkyA, ie, Bhagavan, possessing the JivA as His body, enters the Universe after Srushti, and assumes different forms based on karmA, yet, Bhagavan remains detached from all this, since it is His body (namely, the JivA) that is enjoying the merits and demerits of karma.   
Siddhanta:   
The assertion that Bhagavān has jīva as His body is apramāṇika. Not only is there no pramāņa for that, it even goes against all pramāņas. More over not even a tiny trace of sharIrAtmabhAva is present in the   
verse.   
yathA   
=   
just as   
agniH = fire god or agni deva (presiding deity of fire)   
ekaH   
=   
only one   
bhuvanam prviShTo = entered the world   
rUpaM rUpam = every form (of fire)   
=   
pratirUpo babhUva became pratibimba (of fire)   
tathA = similarly   
sarva-bhUtAnatarAtmA = One who is inner-controller (Lord) of all   
beings   
ekaH only one   
rUpaм rUpam = every form (of Jiva)   
pratirUpo babhUva = became pratibimba (of Lord) bahishcha also outside (meaning different)   
(A is outside B means A is different from B)   
It is a straight forward thing.   
Where did "assumes separate forms in respect of different shapes" and "assumes a form in respect of each shape" come from?   
Further, "this assuming a form with respect to shapes" has nothing to do with shariratmabhava. Atma does not have a shape. So, sharIra does not assume a form in respect of Atma. SharIra has a shape, but Atma does not assume a form in respect of sharIra.   
In addition, one can note the following logical issues as well in their approcah.   
Let us list four possibilities   
—   
1. Bhagavān is bimba and jīva are precisely Pratibimba.   
2. Bhagavān is like bimba and jīva are not exactly Pratibimba, but they are   
like Pratibimba, in the sense that jīva has dependency on Bhagavan and   
possesses some of the charactaristics of Bhagavān.   
3. Jīva is the body of Bhagavān.   
4. Jīva is like the body of Bhagavān in the sense that Bhagavān is inside the   
jīva.   
Both 1. and 2. do not attribute any flaw to Bhagavān. 4. also does not attribute any flaw to Bhagavān as it is drawing only a comparison. But the position 3. taken by Visiṣṭādvaita attributes many flaws to Bhagavān.   
1. Bhagavān has one extra layer than jīva and so is worse off. Even granting that Bhagavān does not have any abhimāna for his body (namely jīva and other bodies of jīva), nevertheless, He is equipped with the bodies.   
2. While going to mokṣa, jīva has cast off all his bodies, but Bhagavān has jīva as His body and so in a way He has eternal bondage of the bodies. That too in mokṣa itself, He has as many bodies as the jīvas in mokṣa.   
3. The jivas have the property of dehanāṣa (or destruction of body). Now the Lord has jīva as the body. Even though jīva has no destruction, his bodies are undergoing destruction. This means these bodies, which are also effectively the bodies of Bhagavān are also undergoing destruction. That means Bhagavān also has the flaw of "dehanāṣa"   
4. Not only jīva, but the Visiṣṭādvaitins also claim that Jagat is the body of Bhagavān. That means when the Jagat is destroyed during Pralaya, that also is effectively dehanāṣa for Bhagavan.   
5. Their argument is that Bhagavān is inside the jiva and so   
jīva is the body. By such an argument a person who is inside the house should be taken as having the house as the body.   
6. Sri Krishna says in Gīta   
—   
avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanumāśritam | paraṁ bhāvamajānanto mama bhūtamaheśvaram   
अवजानन्ति माम् मूढा मानुषीम् तनुमाश्रितम् ।   
परम् भावमजानन्तो मम भूतमहेश्वरम् ॥   
Gītā - 9-11   
गीता -९-११   
It is horrible to think that the Lord has this kind of panchabhautika deha, since the bodies of the jīva are also effectively the bodies of Paramātma and Sri Krishna condemns such an idea.   
7. Since there are all kinds of animals, birds, trees and insects and other living beings, God having those jīvas also as His bodies, must be construed as having their bodies also as His bodies.   
8. The Gita verse says   
—   
antavanta ime dehā nityasyoktāḥ śarīriṇaḥ | anāśino'prameyasya tasmādyudhyasva bhārata ||   
अन्तवन्त इमे देहा नित्यस्योक्ताः शरीरिणः ।   
अनाशिनोऽप्रमेयस्य तस्माद्युध्यस्व भारत ॥   
Gitā - 2-18   
गीता - २ - १८   
The bodies of this eternal embodied one are destructible. Thus Oh, Arjuna perform your duty of doing the war.   
Here if the Lord is embodied one and jīva is the body of the eternal Lord, then this word would imply that the jiva (which is the body of the Lord) becomes destructible. But the intent of the verse is to say that the bodies of the jiva are destructible, but jīva is eternal. That means this verse will result in self-contradiction that the eternal jīva is destructible.   
Let us grant that in all the above cases, He has no attachment to any of His bodies. That will only put Him in "jīvanmukta" state, but will not take away any of those flaws.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Madhva's intention was to show the complete and absolute difference between JivA and ParamAtmA. He could not tolerate even the   
inseparability, ie, Aprtak Siddhi, between JivA and ParamAtMa, as a result of the SarirAtma bhava. This is the reason for the unique theory of Bimba Pratibimba Vada.   
Siddhanta:   
Let us first discuss the confusion between absolute difference and separability.   
Let us list all four possibilities.   
1. Two objects are absolutely different and separable   
2. Two objects are absolutely different and inseparable   
3. Two objects are non-different and inseparable   
4. Two objects are non-different and separable.   
The cases 1. and 2. are possible.   
The cases 3. is trivial and 4. is impossible and so 3. and 4. need not even be considered. Thus apart from 1. and 2., only the other possibility is that the jīva and Brahman are non-different and that is the position taken by Advaita.   
It is wrong to think that two entities, which are absolutely different cannot have inseparability.   
It is wrong to think that Sri Madhvācārya "could not tolerate even the inseparability.". That can result only from serious   
misunderstanding of not only Dvaita philosophy, but of the śāstras in general. The inseparability has been stressed ad nauseum and our Acharya has stressed that ad nauseum.   
"dravyam karma ca kālaśca svabhāvo jīva eva ca yadanugrahataḥ santi na santi yadupekṣayā|"

- गीताभाष्य - २ - १८   
A reflection can get destroyed for 3 reasons   
1. By the destruction of the main object   
—   
2. By the destruction of the reflecting medium (Upādhi)   
3. By moving the mirror out of the main object's realm (sannidhi nāśa)   
1. is not possible because the Lord is eternal.   
2. is not possible because the jiva itself is the medium, who is eternal.   
3. is not possible because the Lord is all-pervading.   
This emphasizes in unequivocal terms the inseparability of jiva and   
Paramātma.   
The following pramāņa-s clearly indicate Bimba Pratibimba bhāva   
Kathopanişat (कठोपनिषत्) says -

"The deity Agni enters all the worlds and performs all activities of the fire. All the inert fires are but reflections of this unique sentient God of fire, Agni. Likewise, the Supreme Lord is the unique sentient being that pervades as the indwelling independent force of all the Jivas. Hence the jivas are different from Lord.   
The deity Vayu enters all the worlds and performs all activities of the fire. All the inert Life-forces are but reflections of this unique sentient God of Life, Vayu. Likewise, the Supreme Lord is the unique sentient being that pervades as the indwelling independent force of all the Jivas. Hence the jivas are different from Lord."

—   
—   
lighting one lamp from another every lamp is full and so every avatāra of Lord is full. When one lamp is lit from another lamp, the prior one does not diminish.   
Jīva sṛṣṭi (que) - Jivas are pratibimbas and so vāri (water) is mentioned. He gives bodies for his pratibimba jīvas.   
jada srsti (जडसृष्टि)   
— -   
It is like transforming mud into pots - changing   
the shapes.   
The following quote from Kürma purāna (कूर्मपुराण) says   
"cetanābhāsako jīvaḥ paramaścetano hariḥ | svatantratvāt svatantro hi naiva doṣeņa lipyate ||"   
चेतनाभासको जीवः परमश्चेतनो हरिः ।   
स्वतन्त्रत्वात् स्वतन्त्रो हि नैव दोषेण लिप्यते ॥   
—   
Kūrmapurāṇa   
- कूर्मपुराण   
"The tiny jīva is alpa cetana and just reflection of paramacetana Sri Hari, because He is independent. Due to His independence, even though He is present inside the jīva, He is untouched by the flaws like sorrow."   
The varāha purāna ( वराहपुराण) says   
—   
"brahmādiguṇavaiśeṣyādānandādiḥ parasya ca | pratibimbatvamāyāti madhyoccādiviśeṣata ||"

"brahmādīnām ca muktānām sukham viṣṇusukhasya tu | pratibimbastu vipluṭko viṣṇoreva param sukham ||"   
ब्रह्मादीनाम् च मुक्तानाम् सुखम् विष्णुसुखस्य तु ।   
प्रतिबिमबस्तु विप्लुट्को विष्णोरेव परम् सुखम्॥   
वराह पुराण   
Varāha purāṇa   
वराह पुराण   
"The deities like Brahma, are but reflections of the Supreme Lord Sri Hari. Their bliss is very little compared to the infinite bliss of the Lord."   
(Note that this not only tells bimba-pratibimbabhāva, but also refutes Ananda sāmya, more about that later.)   
In the following Brahmasūtra, the bimba pratibimbabhāva only is indicated.   
"OM ābhāsa eva ca OM"   
ॐ आभास एव च ॐ   
—   
Brahmasūtra - 2-3-50   
- ब्रह्मसूत्र २ - ३ ५०   
"The jiva is pratibimba of the Lord only."   
Thus there are scriptural statements that support "Bimba-pratibimba bhāva" and there are no scriptural statements that contradict "Bimba-pratibimba bhāva" and so there is no need for any alternate explanation.   
On the other hand, there are no scriptural statements that say that Lord has jīva as the body or the universe as the body and there are scriptural statements that contradict the Lord literally having a body different from him. Thus trying to treat the Lord as "śarīri" by using statements quoted before will go against many scriptural statements and also turns out to be illogical.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Jiva Bheda   
Furthermore, the outcome of Bimba Pratibimba is extended to the jiva bheda as well.   
Siddhānta:   
The outcome of Bimba Pratibimbabhāva bhāva does not have to be "extended" to the jiva bheda. The jiva bheda is pratyakṣasiddha. And also it is Agama siddha. And also it is anumānasiddha.   
1. Pratyaksasiddha:   
When jīva itself is not pratyakṣagocara, how can their bheda be pratyakṣasiddha?   
The people that we see in this world are all different. If the same jīva is present in all the people, then the pain that is felt by any jīva should be felt by every other jīva in this universe. That is unseen and unsupported. Thus they have to be different.   
The Visiṣṭādvaitins themselves would not like to equate themselves with the jīva of their preacher Sri Rāmānuja. Much less would they like to equate the jiva of kalipuruşa or any other despicable jīva with that of Sri Rāmānuja. They are forced to accept jīva-jīva bheda.

These are just as "sthālīpulākanyāya (Py)". The Bhagavadgita is replete with statements that bring out the difference among jīvas.   
In His Viśvarūpa, The Lord shows Adityas, Rudras, Vasus and all kinds of jivas.   
The difference among jīvas is given in scriptures.   
Look at the Sūtra   
—   
which explains why there are differences.   
OM adṛṣṭāniyamāt OM   
—   
Brahmasūtra - 2-3-51   
ॐ अदृष्टानियमात् ॐ   
-   
ब्रह्मसूत्र - २-३-५१   
If a doubt arises that since all the jīvas are pratibimbas of the Lord, they all must resemble one another and must be the same, this sūtra answers that doubt saying that the difference is due to difference in their inherent svabhāva, sams kāras and the consequent anādi karma, which are ādṛṣṭa.   
2. anumānasiddha:   
-   
We see in our daily lives enormous differences in various people. Leave alone people we also see all kinds of living organisms, which indicate difference among jīvas. The Visiṣṭādvaita position that all the jīvas are the same to start with and then undergo this enormous difference and at the end all reach the same kind of mokṣa enjoying   
the same amount of bliss equivalent to the Lord is dead against logic and the Dvaita position that there are differences to start with   
(from beginning-less time) and there are differences as we perceive them today and will reach their respective destinations is sarva pramāņa siddha.   
In fact, it would not make sense that jīvas like Hitler and Duryodhana reach the same destination as jīvas like Brahma, Vāyu, Garuda and Indra.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
MAdhvAs argue that all JivAs are not the same. JivAs can be sattvik, rajasic and tamasic. This difference is basically due to the SvarUpa itself, ie, their essential nature.   
Sattvik JivAs get liberation, whereas tamasic jivAs get eternal hell, ie, their stay in samsArA is permanent.   
Siddhanta:   
Mādhvās clearly point out these well established facts from the scriptures. In simplest terms, one can go thru Gīta and see them for themselves. Some of these Gita verses are pointed below.   
Please note that eternal hell is not "permanent stay in saMsāra". If those two are the same, then our saMsāra must be termed as "short term super-hell".   
Pūrvapaksa:   
The cruel fate of the tamasic jivAs is not attributable to partiality of Sriman Narayana, because the difference in SvarUpa is the JivA's own nature, and as such, Bhagavan is not responsible, since He did not create JivAs. The pramAnAs for this is:   
"Those who are hateful towards me, are cruel and the worst humans in the world; them I forever hurl only into demonic species. Having reached evil species in birth after birth, the fools; completely failing to reach me, only, they then go to the lowest state. - Gita 16.19-20.   
Siddhanta:   
"   
Ofcourse. And not just these verses, there are many verses, which describe the variation of the jīvas and the difference in destinations.   
The following verses mention eternal hell and mokṣa and instructs what to do to get to mokṣa.

"These cruel haters, worst of men, I always throw them into saMsāra (cycles of birth and death) and into demonical wombs.   
Then O Kunti's son, these fools, having acquired the demonical wombs, recursively every birth, never reach me and attain the abysmal hellish realms.   
There are three doors that open to three kinds of hells in the form of self-degeneration - lust, fury and greed. Hence one must forsake these   
three.   
O Kaunteya, one who is free from these three dark doors, indulges in what is for his own welfare and eventually reaches the supreme goal.   
One who forsakes the injunctions of śāstra-s and goes one's own merry way, never acquires perfection, true joy and supreme goal."   
COMMENT: In fact the last three chapters of the Gita, the daivasura sampat vibhaga yoga, the shraddha traya vibhaga and the moxa sannyasa chapters clinch the issue of the jiva traividhya and by extension jiva jiva bheda for the informed reader   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
MAdhvA gives a unique interpretation of Gita 9.32, According to him, all the IthihAsAs and PurAnAs talk of men becoming women in their next birth, but there is absolutely no instance of a woman becoming a man in her next birth. For instance, the rishis of DandakAranyA became gopis, but AmbA only became a eunuch, ie, Sikhandi, and did not become a man. This is due to intrinsic differences in the gender of JivAs. A very radical theory of gender bheda is also postulated by MAdhvA.   
Siddhanta:   
Acharya Madhva never said that all the men become women in their next birth. If that were the case all the male devatas would have been   
born as women.   
If one likes to see the enormous difference between the glorious interpretation given by Acharya Madhva and other Acharyas for the Gita verse 9,32, here it goes. When others gave with the apparent meaning, which is not only ridiculous, but brings down the stature of the women of our tradition, the true purport is brought out by our Acharya.   
māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye'pi syuḥ pāpayonayaḥ | striyo vaiśyāstathā sūdrās te'pi yānti parāṁ gatim ||   
माम् हि पार्थ व्यपाश्रित्य येऽपि स्युः पापयोनयः ।   
स्त्रियो वैश्यास्तथा शूद्रास्तेऽपि यान्ति पराम् गतिम् ॥   
Sri Shankara gave following commentary   
—   
Gītā - 9-32   
गीता - ९-३२   
"mām hi yasmāt pārtha vyapāśritya mām āśrayatvena gṛhītvā ye'pi syuḥ bhaveyuḥ pāpayonayaḥ pāpā yoniḥ yeṣāṁ te pāpayonayaḥ pāpajanmānaḥ – ke te ityāha striyaḥ vaiśyāḥ tathā śūdrāḥ te api yānti gacchanti parāṁ prakṛṣṭām gatim |   
- śankarabhāṣya   
"   
माम् हि यस्मात् पार्थ व्यपाश्रित्य माम् आश्रयत्वेन गृहीत्वा येऽपि स्युः भवेयुः पापयोनयः पापा योनिः येषाम्   
ते पापयोनयः पापजन्मानः - के ते इत्याह स्त्रियः वैश्याः तथा शूद्राः ते अपि यान्ति गच्छन्ति पराम् प्रकृष्टाम्   
गतिम्।   
-   
शन्करभाष्य   
"Seeking refuge in Me (Being dependent on Me), even people of low or sinful birth women, artisans, and serfs achieve the supreme destination of blissful liberation."   
Sri Rāmānuja's is not very different and has the following commentary   
striyaḥ vaiśyāḥ śūdrāḥ ca pāpayonayaḥ api mām vyapāśritya parām gatim yānti |   
Rāmānujabhāṣya   
स्त्रियः वैश्याः शूद्राः च पापयोनयः अपि माम् व्यपाश्रित्य पराम् गतिम् यान्ति ।   
-   
रामानुजभाष्य   
—   
"The women, artisans, and serfs and other evil birth ones attain the supreme state of blissful liberation state".   
Both of them in the next verse   
—   
kiṁ punarbrāhmaṇāḥ puṇyā bhaktā rājarṣayastathā | anityamasukhaṁ lokamimaṁ prāpya bhajasva mām ||   
किम् पुनर्ब्राह्मणाः पुण्या भक्ता राजर्षयस्तथा ।   
Gītā - 9-33   
अनित्यमसुखम् लोकमिमम् प्राप्य भजस्व माम्॥   
गीता - ९-३३   
indicate that Brāhmaṇas and others are punyayonayaḥ (born meritorious) .   
That means both of them indicated that the women and śūdras can never be punyayoni ones.   
Quite magnificently Achārya explains these two verses by simply quoting the Bhaviṣyatparva   
—   
"pāpādikāritāścaiva puṁsāṁ svābhāvikā api |   
vipratvādyāstatra puṇyāḥ svābhāvyā eva muktigāḥ || yānti strītvam pumāmso'pi pāpatah kāmato'pivā |

Madhvabhāşhya for 9-32   
तज्जन्मनि वराः पापजाताभ्यो निजसत्स्त्रियः ॥   
सर्वेषामपि जीवानामन्त्यदेहो यथा निजः ।   
मुक्तौ च निजभावः स्यात् कर्मभोगांस्ततोऽपि च ॥   
इति भविष्यत्पर्ववचनात् पापयोनयः पुण्या इति विशेषणम्   
- मध्वभाष्य - ९-३२   
"Those who are men and are vipra, Kşatriya, Vaiśya and śūdra, by svabhāva (inherent nature), may due to their sins or kāma filled acts, be born as women or Kṣatriyas, etc. However those who are inherently women are never born as men. The only way they can obtain male body is by sharing the body with a male soul from boons, etc. Those who are inherently women and born as women are much superior to males acquiring female bodies. The inherent nature, be it manhood, or womanhood, or Brāhmaṇatva or Kṣatriyatva, etc as per their inherent nature are retained in the liberated state, having fulfilled all prārabdha. "   
Thus from the words of Bhaviṣyatparva, the qualifiers like "pāpayonis" and "punyā-s" are to be understood.   
Sudyumna was born as woman due to sinful act. Agniputras were born as women due to kāma or desire.   
The wrong information that śikhanḍi is a eunuch is based on TV shows and video shows. The misinformation is a product of absence of knowledge from the scriptures. It is a shame that they project him as eunuch and it is worse that people take that as authority.   
Note the following information from Mūla Mahābhārata itself.   
Bhiṣma narrates to Duryodhana the episode of śikhaṇḍi.   
"strīlingam dhārayāmāsa sthūņo yakṣo'tha bhārata |

"O Bharata, the Yakṣa Sthūņa took upon himself the feminity and śikhaṇḍi obtained the effulgent Yakṣa male form.   
Thereupon the Pānchāla prince śikhaṇḍi, acquiring the manhood, entered his city with great joy and went to his father."

"Thereupon that king (The father of sikhaṇḍi's wife is the king of dāśārṇa), hearing the words of Drupada, critical of the situation, sent forth best of the damsels, who were beautiful, to test whether śikhaṇḍi is man or woman.   
O chief of the Kauravas, those damsels, that were dispatched, learnt the truth and were highly pleased. They conveyed to the king of Dāśārṇa that śikhaṇḍi was a man of great strength and impressive stature."   
Further in Bhiṣmaparva, Mahābhārata mentions śikhaṇḍi as Mahārathi and describes how he fights a fierce battle.   
So all these pramāṇa-s clearly indicate that he never had a eunuch's body.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Please refer Sri Tirukallam Swami's Gita Saram to get a comparison of Sri Rāmānuja's and Sri Madhva's views (Sri Sankara's interpretation is also given). The sloka simply states that Brahmanas have both Bhakti Yoga and Prapatti as paths, whereas women, vaishyas and sudras perform prapatti to attain him. These people lack VedhAdhikArA. The Vaishya cannot perform the rite called satra yagna. This is Sri Rāmānuja's viewpoint.Siddhānta:   
All three commentaries were given above and they are pretty much self-explanatory.   
The śloka uses the words "papayonayaḥ", "striyaḥ", "Vaisyāḥ" and "śūdrāḥ".   
What Sri Shankaracharya did was to interpret "papayonayaḥ" as "women", "Vaiśyas" and "śūdras". What Sri Rāmānuja did was to group "pāpayonayaḥ" and "women", "Vaiśyas" and "śūdras" into one. In both cases, there is no clue how to avoid equating those category people and pāpayonis. In effect they are belittling these people in entirety subjecting all of them to a scornful treatment. The slokas dont have any Bhaktiyoga and Prapatti and Sri Rāmānuja also did not make any effort to use those words in the commentary of these verses. So, trying to drag what is not in the verses and also not in the commentary of their Acharya is uncalled for.   
Sri Madhvācārya averted the disaster of demeaning and degrading the entire group.   
Let me further explain this concept with mathematical notation.   
Svābhāvika refers to inherent nature. Aupādhika refers to physical birth.   
=   
S-W   
S-M-P   
Svābhāvika woman   
=   
Svābhāvika man, who committed certain kind of pāpa that begets him Aupādhika womanhood   
say A-W-P   
—   
S-M-Q = Svābhāvika man, who did not commit that kind of pāpa that begets him Aupādhika womanhood and so he will become A-M-Q S-B-P =   
=   
Svābhāvika Brāhmaṇa, who committed certain kind of papa that begets him Aupādhika Vaiśyatva or śūdratva (say A-V-P or A-S-P) S-B-Q Svābhāvika Brāhmaṇa, who did not commit that kind of pāpa that begets him Aupādhika Vaiśyatva or śūdratva and so he will become A-B-Q   
By extension, one can imagine S-K-P and S-K-Q for Kṣatriayas, etc.   
S-W   
S-M-P ==> A-W-P   
==> A-W   
(1) (2)   
S-M-Q ==> A-M-Q   
(3)   
S-B-P ==> A-V-P or A-S-P   
(4)   
S-B-Q ==> A-B-Q   
(5)   
S-K-P ==> A-V-P or A-S-P   
(6)   
S-K-Q ==> A-K-Q   
(7)   
S-V-P ==> A-S-P   
(8)   
S-V-Q ==> A-V-Q   
(9)   
S-S   
==> A-S   
10)   
Note that majority of women (who come under (1)) are not pāpayonis.   
Most of the śūdras (who come under (10)) are not pāpayonis   
A much smaller number (who come under (2), (4), (6) and (8)) are pāpayonis.   
Note that because of certain type of pāpa, some are born in those yonis, which are unnatural to them, and so called pāpayonis.   
It is not that just because they are born in those yonis, they are pāpayonis.   
A birth in a yoni itself does not give pāpa, but certain type of pāpa can give birth in a yoni.   
COMMENT: The fact that the jivas have a gender is sufficient to point to a jiva-jiva bheda, a point sometimes missed if this is not well understood.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Nature of IsvarA - Doctrine of Visesa   
IsvarA is accepted as the possessor of all auspicious qualities. But MadhvAs differ from Vishishtadvaitins on the issue of the identity of substrate and attributes.   
Siddhanta:   
It is scriptures, which differ from Visiṣṭādvaitins.   
The śrutis declare "ānandam brahmaṇo vidvān" (311g4 s&um fagl   
"atha eşa eva parama ānandah" (अथ एष एव परम आनन्दः)   
"ekamevādvitīyam" ( एकमेवाद्वितीयम् )   
"neha nānāsti kiñcana" ( नेह नानास्ति किचन ).   
There is no difference between Lord and His attributes. There is no difference between Lord and His avayavas (or limbs).   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
According to MAdhvAs, the attributes of IsvarA are not distinct from Him, and constitute His essential nature. This is because when we say that there is a difference between substrate and attribute, it can be argued 'what is the difference between this difference and the substrate?' and so on ad infinitum. To avoid this regress, visesa is postulated. Essentially, it states that a thing and its qualities are identical, but can be spoken of as different things. Eg: We say Viṣṇu's Lotus Feet. This implies a difference between Bhagavan and His Lotus Feet. However, if we just say 'Viṣṇu', it includes everything, such as His lotus feet. Hence, we speak of the lotus feet as though it is different from the entity, but in actuality, it is identical to the entity.   
Vishishtadvaitins argue that a substrate and its attributes are different from each other. More on that later.   
Siddhānta:   
The logical inconsistency thru infinite regress is given as an additional proof only.   
There are many scriptural statements as indicated above. Please take a look   
at the Brahmasutras in Parānandādhikarana (परानन्दाधिकरण),   
sthānaviśeŞādhikarana ( स्थानविशेषाधिकरण ) and   
ahikuṇḍalādhikaraṇa (eucu) (which will be explained a bit later). All of them completely refute the Visiṣṭādvaita position in   
Anandasāmya (आनन्दसाम्य) and viśesanirākarana (विशेषनिराकरण). The Lord's   
niravayavatva is accepted by even Advaitins. There is no other way   
out.   
Commenting on "aṁśādhikaraṇa (3)", Sri Shankaracharya says -   
"jīvaḥ iśvarasyāṁśo bhavitumarhati yathāgnerviṣphulingaḥ | amśa ivāṁśo | na hi niravayavasya mukhyo'mśaḥ sambhavati|"

The commentator Bhāmatīkara further comments

"The jiva can be amsa of the Lord just like the the spark of the fire. It only means jīva resembles the amśa, but in reality it is not amśa as it is impossible to be an amsa of "niravayava" Lord Lord can not be split into parts.   
—   
"Because jiva is controlled by Brahman, it is called as amsa, but in reality   
it is not an amsa".   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
Loose Ends   
All important points have been covered. A few extras:   
1) MAdhvAs do not accept the theory of Nitya Suris. Only Lakṣmi is Nitya Mukta (because of Her intrinsic nature) but no-one else. So, this means for MAdhvAs, Adi Sesha and Garuda are Baddha JivAS.   
Siddhanta:   
The Visiṣṭādvaita position of Nityasuris will lead to lot of difficulties. It will also be explained later. It is not "for Madhvas", but it is as per the pramāņa-s.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
2) MadhvAs do not accept the Sat KhyAti VAdA theory of error, as propounded by Vishishtadvaitins, but endorse AnyathA KhyAti. More on   
that later.   
Siddhānta:   
The Viśiṣṭādvaita position of Khyāti Vāda will lead to lot of difficulties. It will also be explained later.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
3) MAdhvAs do not accept the theory of avEsha avatara. Vyasa, for instance, is a purna avatArA.   
Siddhānta:   
This indeed, is a strange argument. This is like saying "Mr. X does not believe in any flying objects. He makes his living by working as a pilot of an airplane". How can any one say " MAdhvAs do not accept the theory of avEsha avatara. Vyasa, for instance, is a purna avatArA" ?   
Leave alone the inconsistency of logic, it is completely wrong statement also.   
Mādhvās not only accept the theory of aveśa and avatāra, they are very precise and give enormous weightage to it.   
In fact, they explain āveśa and avatāra of the Lord and also other deities. For other deities, the avatāras can be just amśa. In case of the Lord, as He is always "pūrṇa", His amsa is also pūrṇa as His avatāra. But when it comes to āveśa (which is just lending some special power), just āveśa need not be avatāra.   
For example, the Lord's āveśa is there in Balarama (who is actually an incarnation of seṣa).   
Dvaita explains that thinking an avatāra of the Lord as non-avatāra or non--avatāra of the Lord as avatāra constitutes one of the nine kinds of dveṣa.   
The Visiṣṭādvaita believes in partial avatāra of the Lord by going against the śruti pramāņa –   
"pūrṇamadaḥ pūrṇamidam pūrṇātpurṇamudacyate | pūrṇasya pūrṇamādāya pūrṇamevāvaśiṣyate ||"   
पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदम् पूर्णात्पूर्णमुदच्यते ।   
पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते॥   
Even logically also, a fraction of infinity is also infinity only.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
They also do not accept that the archa thirumeni of the Lord is Suddha Sattvam.   
Siddhanta:   
The Viśiṣṭādvaita believes in "archa avatāra" and they think that the icon of the Lord is an incarnation of the Lord. Dvaita position is that the icon can have special sannidhāna and be a special adhiṣṭhāna of the Lord in the same space that the icon is occupying. In other words, the Lord's special presence is there and this varies based on many factors like the icon being svayambhu, the tapaśśakti of the one doing pratiṣṭha, the place, the process of pratiṣṭha using mantras, the devotion of the devotees coming and praying, etc. Of course, all these are as per the will of the Lord.   
Let us look at what makes sense and what does not.   
Firstly, we know that as the sculptor is making the icon, he may sit on it, he may step on it and treat it as if it is a toy in his hand. For him it is an important task to be completed. So, does that mean he is actually doing all this to avatāra of the Lord. Let us assume that after the pratiṣṭha, it suddenly becomes the avatāra. Then we also saw that during Muslim regime, the muslims broke many icons. Does that mean that they broke the "avatara-s of the Lord"? If one thinks that they are not avatāra-s, but just "śuddha satvam", do the muslims have capacity to destroy "śuddha satvam"? Otoh, if we think of "sannidhāna" as per the will of the Lord, then there can be two possibilities   
1. There was no sannidhāna of the Lord already and the muslims could break them.   
2. There was sannidhāna of the Lord, but before the act of muslims, the Lord took out the sannidhāna and allowed the muslims to cause the   
destruction.   
Do they think that the icon was "śuddha sattva" from the beginning (meaning the stone was made of suddha sattva and the icon was made from śuddha sattva or it becomes śuddha sattva at the time of "pratiṣṭha"? In either case, they face the following difficulty.   
If they think that the icon is not avatāra, but just "śuddha sattva", even then, how can the muslims or other vandals have the capacity to destroy "śuddha sattva"?   
We must not get mixed up between sannidhāna and avatāra and suddha sattva.

The Vijayindra ParAjayA is a wonderful work in defense of Vishishtadvaita. It has 5 chapters, but is extremely rare. Adiyen possesses the english translation of 2 chapters, one refuting visesa and another refuting ananda tAratamya. SrinivAsAchAryA has also authored Ananda TAratamya Khandana, but this is a more comprehensive work. The period of VijayanagarA was extremely interesting. The debates between the three schools were fierce. There were 3 major scholars Appayya Dikshitar for Advaita, ParakAla Yati for Vishishtadvaita and Vijayindra Tirtha for Dvaita. The headquarters of the latter two was in Kumbakonam, near our ArAvamudhan koil. Vijayindra Tirtha was leading the MAdhvA population of Tamil Nadu at the time. He is also reported to have settled a dispute when the Saiva temple in Kumbakonam claimed that the pushkarini of SArangapAni belonged to their temple. The debates between these three were wonderful and triangular. Each scholar attempted to refute the other two simultaneously, which lead to some very interesting debates. All 3 were well matched, but in the end Appayya Dikshitar was defeated by both Vijayindra Tirtha and ParakAla Yati (later on by DoddAchAryA). ParakAla Yati also refuted Vijayindra Tirtha's objections to   
Vishishtadvaita.   
Siddhanta:   
These false stories against the historical truth are spread needlessly. Sri Vyāsatīrtharu successfully refuted in his work Candrika a few positions taken by Viśiṣṭādvaita. They attempted criticisms of that work. Sri Vijayīndratīrtha   
wrote a work called "Sarva-siddhānta-sārāsāra-vivecanam (H¶-fAGI-ARIAR-   
f‍) (1 and 2)". In Sarva-siddhānta-sārāsāra-vivecanam-1, Sri Vijayīndratīrtharu refutes the criticisms of Visiṣṭādvaita. Sri Tatacharya also known as Sri Parakāla yati wrote a work "Vijayīndra Parājaya" attempting a refutation. However those criticisms have already been effectively anticipated and addressed by Sri Vijayīndratīrtha in his Sarva-siddhānta-sārāsāra-vivecanam-1 itself.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Though Dvaitins do not accept that Vijayindra Tirtha was ever defeated, the obvious fact is that until today, there has been no reply or rebuttal to the Vijayindra ParAjaya. Some modern day Dvaitins have attempted a rebuttal (BN Hebbar), but it is clearly an inferior work, with poor understanding of Vishishtadvaita. Let us celebrate the victory of Parakāla Yati, who comes in the sishya paramparai of Kavi TArkika Simham, the renowned VedAnta Desikan himself.   
Siddhanta:   
What an argument? Just because Sri Parakāla yati wrote a work named "Vijayīndra Parājaya" and a false claim that there had not been an effective rebuttal, one tries to conclude that Sri Vijayindra tīrtharu was defeated, then look at the following. Sri Vijayīndra tīrtharu wrote a work called "Appayya-kapola-capețika" (which means "a slap on the cheek of Sri Appayya Dikṣita"). Saying that there is no effective rebuttal, can we conclude that Sri Vijayīndratīrtha went and physically slapped Sri Appayya Dikṣita? In spite of such vigorous philosophical exchanges, they maintained a very cordial relationship till end on personal level.   
For more details regarding polemic criticisms and exchanges between Dvaita and Visiṣṭādvaita, please refer to pages 405-407 of "History of the Dvaita School of Vedanta" by Dr. BNK Sharma.   
Further looking at the strawman arguments of Sri Parakāla yati in "Vijayīndra Parājaya", one can imagine, why many scholars ignored that work. There is no end to all kinds of claims. The Advaita camp claims that Sri Parakāla yati was defeated by Sri Appayya Dīkṣita. Instead of running after all those claims and instead of blindly labeling "this is inferior, that is inferior", let us address the core issues with an open mind. Sri Satyadhyānatīrtha refuted in open sabha all the objections of the Visiṣṭādvaita scholars. Further in the commentary "Bhāvadīpa" on Tatvaprakāśika of Sri Jayatīrtha, Sri Raghavendraswamy refutes the objections of Sri Parakala yati. Thus in light of all these - "Parakāla-yati-kṛta-Vijayīndra-parājaya-paramarśaḥ   
parāstah eva" (परकाल-यति-कृत-विजयीन्द्र-पराजय-परमर्शः परास्तः एव ) The assaulting   
conclusion of Parakāla yati that he defeated Sri Vijayīndratīrtha is to be rejected only). So, celebrating an imaginary victory is only a false sense of joy.   
The purpose of this write-up is to answer all the objections of Visiṣṭādvaita.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
The non-difference between a substrate and its attributes is refuted in the Vijayendra ParAjaya. ParakAla Yati bases himself on the Tattva Mukta KalapA of VedAnta Desikan.   
He uses the example of "blue jug". The MAdhvAs think that the conception of the jug carries all its qualities, such as the blue color and these qualities have no separate existence from it. In other words, we can say blue jug, but when we say 'jug', it itself includes the quality of blueness in it. Hence, blueness is identical with the jug, but is spoken of differently.   
Siddhanta:   
I don't know if this person is misquoting Sri Parakāla Yati or if Sri Parakāla yati himself says that. It sounds more like the latter as confirmed by another statement given further below. It is a clear misrepresentation of the whole thing. Acharya Madhva clearly and emphatically explains visesa in the Gitatatparya great yatis of the tradition such as Sri Jayatīrtha, Sri Vyāsa Tirtha and Sri Rāghavendra Swamy have followed the same and it is pratyakṣasiddha and drives home the point very clearly.   
First of all, one must differentiate between cetana (sentient) and jaḍa (inert).   
—   
In case of cetana, everything that is inherent of cetana is non- different from cetana as that cetana is "acchedya (Note the Gita verse)". In case of jaḍa, the attributes are of two kinds   
"yāvaddravyabhāvi" (da) (lasts as long as the object lasts) and   
"ayāvaddravyabhāvi" (e) (does not last as long as the object lats). In case of "yāvaddravyabhāvi", there is non-difference. In case of "ayāvaddravyabhāvi", there is both difference and non- difference - difference in one aspect and non-difference in another. In case of such attributes, those attributes may have been lost either naturally or through manual intervention. More later.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
This is refuted as follows. A normal (colorless) jug may assume a blue color on heating or by any treatment, so we know that the quality stands out from the jug, and hence is different from the jug.   
Siddhānta:   
There is no need to go thru that much trouble to give an example, where an "inseparable attribute" is getting destroyed. Take a green banana or a green mango. As they become ripe, the greenness vanishes   
and they assume yellowness (just like the jug assuming blueness). The Pūrvapakṣa claims   
1. The greenness or yellowness or whiteness or blueness, etc. are not banana itself or mango itself or jar itself.   
2. There are so many other blue objects, green objects and yellow objects.   
3. There are bananas and mangoes which are not green. There are also bananas and mangos which are not yellow. There are jars which are blue and there jars which are not blue.   
4. This means these colors and these objects are different. They can not be said to be non-different.   
1., 2. and 3. are true. 4. has to be analyzed properly.   
When the colors are present, can the color alone be separated from the object. Surely, one can destroy the colors, but not give a separate existence to those colors of those objects, as and when they are in the inherent nature of the object.   
One agrees that jarness cannot be separated from jar. Banana-ness cannot be separated from Banana and mango-ness can not be separated from mango just as cow-ness cannot be separated from cow.   
Suppose a jar had a handle. The handle was part of the jar. The handle is not different from jar and at the same time the handle is not same as the jar. The handle is part of the jar and at the same time the handle is different from the jar. It only depends on how one looks at it. Suppose the handle broke. Still one calls the jar "a jar" (It is just that it does not have a handle any more).   
—   
The concept can be seen even more clearly with cloth and its threads. Are the threads same as the cloth or different from the cloth. One tends to say "thread is not same as the cloth. They are different". Then take away all the threads, the cloth is also gone. Suppose one says they are the same. Then put just a pile of threads one doesn't call it a cloth. There is kāryakāraṇabheda (one is a product produced from other), but not "vastutaḥ bheda". This is the case for jaḍas. The total aggregate of the attributes makes up the object. Each attribute is an amśa of the object and is inseparable from that.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
The quality of color has the jug as its support and hence, may flow into it or not depending on circumstances.   
Siddhānta:   
The color never flows into the object. It is either integral part or   
external (like one wraps an object with a color paper, then one can remove the paper so the color is gone, but there it is not integral part of the object.)   
Pūrvapaksa:   
It is wrong to state that the inseparability of the jug from the color is the essential nature of the jug that determines the incoming quality, for the present dispute is ABOUT the existence of such an inseparable association.   
Siddhanta:   
This is incorrect. If it is the quality, how can it come in. The quality is inherent for an object. If the quality is external to the object and some X1 brings an association between the quality and the object, then they needs another entity (say X2) that brings association between the object and X1. Then they need another X3 that brings association between X2 and the object. Thus they will end up in infinite regress. They are forced to accept viseṣa to extricate themselves from infinite regress.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
The MAdhvAs may argue that such an inseparable association between substance and attributes is admitted by Sri Rāmānuja, but ParakAla Yati argues that it is only during the time of union of the quality and the substance that such an inseparability is admitted.   
Siddhānta:   
First of all Madhvas do not talk of association between substance and its attributes. Secondly, how can there be union of the quality and substance when they are inseparable. It is mistake after mistake. Thirdly, assuming that the Madhvas are not aware of the transience of some of the attributes is incorrect, when   
"ayāvaddravyabhāvi" (3) concept is not only presented, but its role is properly theorized.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
In which case, the MAdhvAs themselves do not say blueness and jug is same, leading to the acceptance of the jug being qualified by the quality of Blueness. (Special Note: Only when blueness is with jug do we say its inseparable. Inseparability is not there when jug is not blue. Hence, we cannot say inseparability is the essential nature of the jug, resulting in identity of blue color with the jug)Siddhānta:   
—   
That is precisely what is "ayāvaddravyabhāvi" (some attributes that don't last as long as the object itself like greenness of banana, yellowness of mango, etc.).   
Perhaps meant to say "we cannot say blueness is the essential nature of the jug, resulting...". Of course we cannot. Same way we cannot say yellowness is essential nature of Mango. One of the differences is in the duration of their stay.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Some MadhvAs argue that there is both difference and identity, but upon observation, no-one can differentiate between a substance and its qualities, so difference between substance and qualities cannot be made.   
Siddhānta:   
That is identity - difference between substance and qualities cannot be made.   
They do not last the same, one cannot make jug out of blueness alone   
that is the difference.   
—   
So, mādhvas say that there is both difference and identity. They also prove and demonstrate. But, then Visiṣṭādvaitins, intending to attack mādhvas charge out and say that it is wrong and without even their own realization conclude exactly the same "upon their own   
observation"   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
However, Sri ParakAla Yati states that this theory is invalid because a proper definition of reality must be non-contradictory and invariable at all times.   
Siddhānta:   
-   
he   
If some one says "Mr. X is tough with bad guys and soft with good guys", no one will argue "How can Mr. X be both tough and soft should be non-contradictory and invariable at all times." Two different things in two different contexts. Same way here different ways different in some respect and inseparable in another - exactly as per their own observation.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
—   
—   
two   
"Blueness of Jug" and "Blue Colored Jug" are also phrases that differentiate blueness and jug. Hence, it would be incorrect to attempt a definition based on the phrase "blue jug" only. The jug   
appears qualified by "blueness" here. Hence, it is distinct from the quality that qualifies it.   
Siddhanta:   
—   
In case of "pratyakṣasiddha" objects, one coins/builds the phrases based on the facts, truths and thoughts. The converse is not true namely one will not modify or change the facts, truths and thoughts based on the phrases. So in an effort to find the facts, why should one chase the phrases?   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Furthermore, substances are differentiated from one another only basis of their individual qualities.   
Siddhanta:   
Precisely. That is why Viseșa is useful not only as bhedapratinidhi, when abheda is there, but also as the differentiator with respect to others. The individual qualities of a jug not only helps to know about that jug, but also helps to differentiate from another (say) identical jug, which may have 'same color, same weight, same texture, same shape, etc.'. Both jugs may be blue, but we do not say that blueness of one jug is non-different from blueness of another jug. Each one is its viseṣa.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
If all qualities are identical with their respective substances, there would be no way to differentiate the substances from one another.   
Siddhānta:   
Quite contrarily, that is how we differentiate. Let [Q1] be the set of all the qualities of jug J1 and [Q2] be the set of all the qualities of jug J2. Even though the jugs J1 and J2 look identical,   
[Q1], which is inseparable from J1 helps you to differentiate J1 from J2. Similarly [Q2], which is inseparable from J2 helps you to differentiate J2 from J1.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Perception does not reveal the svarUpa as such, but only reveals the qualities of a substance, which is different from the qualities of another substance.   
Siddhanta:   
Perception does not reveal the svarūpa - this is a vague statement. For the second part, please see the above.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
(Special Note: Blue Colored Jug implies difference and Blue Jug implies identity. So, one contradicts the other. Hence, it is wrong to say the blueness and jug are identical taking only the latter definition as authority. The jug is qualified by the blue color, and hence, the two are different from each other.)   
Siddhanta:   
Expressions do not make defintions and definitions do not make conclusions. Conclusions make some of the definitions and definition make some of the expressions. Whether people use the expressions "Blue colored Jug" or "Blue jug", they mean the same thing. It is meaningless to argue that they mean difference in the former and identity in the latter. Authoritativeness r conclusions are not drwan from the expressions, but from the facts.   
There is lot of "charvitacharvaṇam (f) (Chewing the chewed)".   
That is also like churning the churned. In other words, we see a repetition of pattern in the false accusations that others are making conclusions from the expressions.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
In addition, there are a number of qualities besides blueness possessed by the jug and it cannot be said that the jug is identical simultaneously with all its qualities.   
Siddhanta:   
Of course not. The jug is blue and smooth. Blueness and smoothness are inseparable from the jug simultaneously. By some chemical process, both blueness and smoothness can be made to go. So, they   
are "ayāvaddravyabhāvi" and so simultaneously, blueness and smoothness are different from the jug.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Furthermore, the qualities themselves are distinct from one another.   
Siddhānta:   
Of course. From the above example, the blueness is different from smoothness. Suppose both the jugs are made of iron. The ironness is   
"yāvaddravyabhāvi".   
So, the ironness is non-different from the jug. The blueness is also different from the jug and so the blueness is also different from ironness.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
A blind man can touch the jug and understand its texture, but he cannot see the color. So, even the quality of color is different from the quality of texture.   
Siddhanta:   
Even a person who can see knows that the color is different from texture. They are "ayāvaddravyabhāvi" and so they are different from elephant and they are also different from one another.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
ParakAla Yati also states that we need to say "The Jug HAS color" and not "The Jug IS color". Hence, MAdhvA"s theory is illogical.   
Siddhānta:   
It is a double whammy. Firstly one can say "The Jug is Blue". Secondly, on one side they are saying that we should not use expressions to judge identity or difference and on another side, they are doing exactly the same. In matters of pratyakṣa, one should not run after the expressions. Only for tatvas that are beyond pratyakṣa, one is obliged to use sabda pramāṇa, but for that apauruşeya vedas and all the scriptures that support them are the pramāṇa.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
ADIYEN'S COMMENTS:   
Later on, it is said that ParakAla Yati gives a number of Upaniṣadic statements which suggest a difference between substance and attributes, and which would be rendered absurd if the MAdhvA theory was upheld. Adiyen does not have a copy of the rest of the work, but I can hazard a guess as to what those vAkyAs may be. The Anandavalli praises the kalyAna gunAs of Brahman more than Brahman itself. The Chandogya Up. states in the Dahara Vidya section,   
"There is in this city of Brahman an abode, the small lotus of the heart; within it is a small akasa. Now what exists within that small akasa, that is to be sought after, that is what one should desire to understand."   
Sri Ranga Rāmānuja Muni translates akasa as Brahman, and what is within that akasa as the kalyAna gunAs of Brahman. This is mentioned in the next verse as "It contains earth, heaven, fire, air, etc..." meaning, "all objects of enjoyment are these gunAs, contained in this akAsA. So, this in adiyen's opinion, indicates a difference between Brahman and its qualities. Plus, the statement also indicates that the gunAs are so desirable, that they are praised more than Brahman Himself in this context. But this does not denigrate Brahman's   
greatness, as the gunAs are inseparable from Him and constitute His essential nature.   
Siddhanta:   
The biggest blunder they are committing is not even differentiating the jaḍa and cetana in this analysis, which is one of the main reasons for their untold miseries and troubles. They face the apasiddhānta endlessly by presuming that Brahman and His guņa-s are different.   
Further in an eagerness to reject "Madhva theory", an absurd, inconsistent, and untold-in-śruti interpretation of the śruti passage is being passed on and this goes against other śruti pramāṇa-s and Brahmasūtras and hence unvedic as well.   
"OM atha yadidamasmin brahmapure daharam puṇḍarīkam veśma | daharo'sminnantarākāśaḥ | tasmin yadantaḥ tadanveṣṭavyam |

When the teacher tells above words to the disciple, the disciple puts forth a query.   
Then the disciples can ask the teacher as below   
—   
"You told that A small abode in the form of the Lotus-heart takes refuge in the All-pervading, Ever-auspicious and Ever-full Lord, pervading this body. In this abode resides a small dahara-ākāśa. In that one what else can exist? What is there that is to be sought and known?" (perhaps raising a small question as to how can the all- pervading Lord be present in such small place)   
"sa brūyāt yāvānvā ayamākāśastāvāneṣo'ntarhṛdaya akāśa

- छान्दोग्य ८-१-१   
"For that the teacher replies ākāśa nāmaka parabrahma is present in that small abode in the form of the Lotus-heart. Just as the Lord pervading outside the dahara-ākāśa is infinite by space, time and auspicious qualities, the same Lord, who is present in dahara-ākāśa is also All-infinite. (He is to be sought and and contemplated upon.) In Him seeking his support reside the mukta (liberated) and amukta (non-liberated) abhimāni devatas of svarga, bhūmi, agni, vāyu, Surya, lightning, stars and all others devatas as well. The amuktas are useful for the jiva to do sadhana and so their presence is fruitful. The amuktas are as good as not there for the jivas as they are not useful for the jīva to make the sādhana. Nevertheless, they are all there inside the Lord."   
Where is the mention of the qualities? Where is the mention of difference between Brahman and the qualities? Why all that svakapolakalpita thoughts that too contradicting the basic concept in the scriptures? Why that pure speculation?   
Who cares what their opinion is? What is important is what the śāstras say and what makes sense. They call this external jñāna as   
dharmabhūtajñāna (5) (hence forth will be referred as DBJ) and the oddities and absurdities that choke their philosophy will be put forth later on.   
If Brahman and His qualities are different, here in dahara-ākāśa, what is the seeker seeking - the Lord or His qualities? If He is sought, then the qualities lose significance. If His qualities are sought, He loses His significance. If both are sought, that has to be mentioned explicitly. But there is nothing of that sort.   
If guṇa-s are praised more than Brahman Himself in this context, why is that not mentioned? Praising one more will never denigrate the other. That worry need not be there at all. The question is what are we seeking?   
Further look at this self-contradiction in one breath and one   
sentence   
"the gunAs are inseparable from Him and constitute His essential nature"   
They talk of inseparability of guņa-s along with the assumption that they are different and also claim that they constitute His essential nature. If they are different, then they do not constitute His essential nature. One can easily see the self-contradiction.   
Since this is such a messy position, one can see how they have to wriggle, jiggle, and struggle to get out of this mess.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
(EDIT: Some queries were raised about what I meant when I stated, "But this does not denigrate Brahman's greatness, as the gunAs are inseparable from Him and constitute His essential nature". I did not phrase this sentence properly. What I meant is that, glorification of Brahman's attributes, which are inseparable from Brahman, and which arise as a consequence of His essential nature being jñānAnandamayam, ultimately culminates in the glorification of Brahman Himself, and hence, praising the gunAs over Brahman is not a defect. This is explained by Sri Ranga Rāmānuja Muni in the Taittiriya Bhashya. The gunAs are different from His essential nature, inseparably linked to, and arise from His essential nature as well.).   
Siddhānta:   
What a mess! When pushed to corner, what people do is mix up some valid statements with their invalid statements and if anyone questions, then project that they are questioning the valid statements. One must have the ability to separate the wheat from the chaff.   
One must also note that the example of Jadas cannot be used to justify their position in explaining the cetanas. The same kind of rules need not apply for both these. Further for cetanas, a big help comes from the scriptures and a proper logical thinking must be clubbed with that. In matters that are inconceivable, sheer logic cannot be applied. But for matters, which need logic, we must think logically. Otherwise, we will be ending up in self-contradiction only.

To start with, assuming that the Lord's guṇa-s are different from the Lord is abhyupagama vāda. After assuming that, one will pose the question are they separable from Him or not? They are separable from Him leads to a ridiculous position. And so they conclude that they are inseparable from Him. But the issue is the first step itself. How can one conclude that the Lord's guṇa-s are different from the Lord? It is against scriptures and against logic. See   
"ahikuṇḍalādhikaraṇa" (3⁄4ēģucœlfu) in Brahmasūtras.   
(अहिकुण्डलाधिकरण)   
"OM ubhayavyapadeśāttu ahi kuṇḍalavat OM"   
ॐ उभयव्यपदेशात्तु अहिकुण्डलवत् ॐ

Brahmasūtra - 3-2-28   
- ब्रह्मसूत्र - ३-२-२८   
Scriptures mention Brahman is bliss and Brahman's bliss - both such usages can be there. But both are the same. There is no difference between the two - like the coil of the snake and snake-coil. There cannot be snake-coil without the snake. That is the closest jaḍa example that can be given. If the bliss and Brahman are different, there is no need for this sūtra. And the sutras before and after set a stage for this concept.   
Visiṣṭādvaita is also wrong in saying that the guṇa-s are different from His essential nature. See the following from Kaṭhopaniṣat.   
yathodakaṁ durge vṛṣṭaṁ parvateṣu vidhāvati |   
evaṁ dharmān pṛthak paśyaṁstānevānuvidhāvati || - Kaṭhopaniṣat - 2-1-14   
यथोदकम् दुर्गे वृष्टम् पर्वतेषु विधावति ।   
एवम् धर्मान् पृथक् पश्यंस्तानेवानुविधावति॥   
- कठोपनिषत् - २-१-१४   
"On the mountains, in hard-to-reach peak places, when the rain falls, slides down fast; just like that one, who sees difference between God and His guṇa-s and one guna and another guna of the Lord goes to the nether worlds, flowing down fast."   
Hence one must not see any diference between the Lord and His guņas. The right knowledge that there is no difference between the Lord and His guna-s/dharmas will rule out their DBJ concept.   
Now let us reason that out. They are claiming that they are inseparably linked. What links them and Who links them and when the link was made. Does another sentient substance links or non-sentient substance links? Why Should God link to the guṇa-s and before linking, were they lying around somewhere? In jaḍa substances, one can see the inseparability as non-difference like "mango-ness" and mango". One can speak of inseparability in case of non-difference and in case of difference also. The mangoness and mango are non-different and inseparable. The jīva and Paramātma are different and inseparable in one way that jīva cannot exist without Paramātma. Where ever jīva is there Paramātma is there, but we cannot say that wherever Paramātma is there, that particular jīva is also there.   
Now look at the interlacing valid and invalid statements.   
glorification of Brahman's attributes, acceptable   
which are inseparable from Brahman,   
This is universally   
vague - inseparable and non-   
different or   
different ? If it is former   
is fine; if latter then it is not.   
inseparable and   
then that   
and which arise as a consequence of His essential nature being jñānAnandamayam,   
"His essential nature being jñānAnandamayam" acceptable   
This is universally   
How can one conclude that the Lord is different from His qualities from the above?   
This is what is called "pṛṣṭatāḍanāddantabhangaḥ" (YealGalegaHE:)   
teeth falling off from a smack on the back).   
ultimately culminates in the glorification of Brahman Himself,   
glorification of Brahman   
This is universally acceptable   
(The   
How can one conclude that the Lord's difference from His qualities culminates in the above? This is another case of "pṛṣṭatāḍanāddantabhangaḥ".   
and hence, praising the gunAs over Brahman is not a defect. question of praising one over the other arises only after it is established? Why indulge in abhyupagamavAda?   
This is explained by Sri Ranga Rāmānuja Muni in the Taittiriya Bhashya.   
Did he really get into this and explain it as such?   
The   
The gunAs are different from His essential nature, inseparably linked to, and arise from His essential nature as well.) - This is a self- contradiction.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
In addition, Brahman is defined by the qualities of Satyatvam, jñānatvam, Anantatvam, Anandatvam and Amalatvam.   
Siddhānta:   
It is not possible to define Brahman as defining an entity is putting   
a limitation to that. Brahman is beyond any definition. Note   
yato vāco nivartante aprāpya manasā saha Upanisat - 2-4-1   
-   
Taittirīya   
यतो वाचो निवर्तन्ते अप्राप्य मनसा सह   
- तैत्तिरीय उपनिषत् - २-४-१   
-   
Defining is claiming a complete understanding of some thing.   
Otoh, if one says God has infinite qualities like Satyatvam, jñānatvam, Anantatvam, Anandatvam and Amalatvam. This is like claiming a little understanding.   
Also, one must note the difference between sentient (cetana) and non- sentient (jaḍa). The qualities of sentient and the qualities of non- sentient will be different. No one will say that a stone has jñāna or Ananda. No one will say that so and so jīva is hard, soft, wet, dry, green, yellow or pink, etc.   
In case of qualities of jaḍa, the qualities can be "yāvaddravyabhāvi"   
(a) or "ayāvaddravyabhāvi"(E). But in case of cetana, (यावद्द्रव्यभावि the qualities are all "yāvaddravyabhāvi" only, otherwise, one will be forced to attribute vikāra for cetana. It is quite well-known that during saMsāra avastha, the abhivyakti will not be there. So, for cetanas, the qualities will be non-different from the cetana. For jaḍas, the yāvaddravyabhavi qualities are non-different from the substance and ayāvaddravyabhavi qualities will have bheda and abheda.   
That is why for Brahman, one may say "Brahman is jñāna and Ananda" or "Brahman has jñāna and Ananda". Both are correct.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
If He is identical to these qualities, then there is no way to get a grasp of the nature   
Siddhānta:   
Quite contrarily, if identical then only one can get grasp. If not identical, one should ask oneself - Is the jñāna of Brahman sentient or non-sentient? If it is sentient, who is that sentient? If it is non-sentient, how can a sentient entity have a jaḍa as its quality?   
Let us take one guņa, svarūpajñāna of the Lord for example. If He is different, then it must be external to the Lord. Since they are different, is He inside the jñāna or Is this external jñāna of the Lord inside Him? - In either case, He is dependent on jaḍa jñāna. Same way, He will be dependent on his all other guṇa-s as well. This will be a huge flaw in Him.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
MAdhvAs, on the basis of Visesa, argue that the body of SrimanNarayana is His svarUpa as well, and no difference between rupam and svarUpam exists.   
Siddhānta:   
The viseṣas is a process of explaining. The basis is śāstras and Brahmasutras. Also the reasoning will also lead to that only. Please see ahikuṇḍalādhikaraṇņa.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
The SubhAsrayam chapter of Viṣṇu PurAnA is useful in this regard to differentiate Brahman and its body, refuting the MAdhvA conception.   
Siddhanta:   
That is an empty claim. There is nothing that differentiates Brahman and its body. That is attributing flaws to the Brahman. And also that goes against the scriptures, as will be shown later on.   
Further, the quotes from Viṣņu purāṇa that they use go against their own claims.   
viṣṇoḥ sakāśādudbhūtaṁ jagat-tatraiva ca sthitaṁ stithisamyamakartā'sau jagato'sya jagacca saḥ   
विष्णोः सकाशादुद्भूतम् जगत्-तत्रैव च स्थितम् ।   
स्तिथिसंयमकर्ताऽसौ जगतोऽस्य जगच्च सः ॥   
where 'jagat cha saḥ'( :) directly equates Viṣṇu with the world.   
Isn't that the self-destructive position of Visiṣṭādvaita?   
Their position -   
P1. As stated, Viṣṇu purāṇa differentiates Brahman and its body.   
P2. They also claim that jagat is His body.   
(Vi Pu 1.1.35)   
वि पु १-१-३५   
P3. The above quote directly equates Viṣṇu with the world, which is His body!!   
Since Visiṣṭādvaita takes all these literally, Brahman is equated with His body and also differentiated from His body. One can see an obvious self-contradiction.   
Otoh, if they understand the following basic concept and do not take things literally, they will be free from these terrible difficulties.   
There are three ways an identity or non-difference statement can be given.   
I-1. Two sentient beings   
I-2. Two non-sentient beings   
I-3. One sentient and one non-sentient being   
In case of I1, either one sentient being is under the full control of another sentient being or one sentient being is compared to another sentient being in some respects, but not all.   
When the Lord is equated to another deity like Brahma, Rudra, Vayu, Indra, et al, there are atleast three ways, one can undrestand that.   
I-1a. The Lord is also known by those names and those names describe the Lord and etymologically they may have different roots. Or even if the roots are the same, in case of the Lord, the referred qualities bear full potency and in case of the others, they don't.   
I-1b. The Lord is present with those names inside them.   
I-1c. The Lord fully controls them bearing the very same names.   
One may see some overlapping in the above three sub-aspects.   
Then there are expressions like paramam sāmyamupaiti. Here the comparison is in some respects only, but not all. Being devoid of sorrow, having reached one's own Fullness (which again varies based on the inherent capacity), being without a gross body, etc are some of the respects, which are common to the Lord and the mukta jīvas. Hence the similarity is mentioned, which may sound like equality, but there is enough information that tells us what it is.   
We say "The king is a lion in the battlefield". Here the comparison is in the ferociousness, but not in all the qualities. One would not expect the king to walk on his fours.   
In case of I-2, when we hear expressions like "The king's sword is Vajrāyudha only", we know that the king's sword is like Vajrāyudha.   
If we use "like", it is "Upamālankāra"(3441♡§R ).   
If we use identity itself, it is "Rūpakālankāra"(R)   
In case of I-3, it will be like this. If cetana C is in control of a jada J, we tend to use expressions that equate C and J. Suppose a person X is fully in charge of an organization G, we may say X is G. What we mean is X fully controls G.   
The followng verses are from Viṣṇupurāṇa.   
paramārthasthvamevaiko nānyo asti jagatapateḥ tavaiṣā mahimā yena vyāptametaccarācaraṁ |   
परमार्थस्त्वमेवैको नान्योऽस्ति जगतः पते।   
(Vi Pu 1.4.38)   
तवैषा महिमा येन व्याप्तमेतच्चराचरम्॥   
वि पु १-४-३८   
"You alone are Paramartha. Oh, Lord of the universe, there is no one else, who is Paramartha. Your this mahima or glory pervades this entire universe of moving and non-moving entities."   
There is no indication that the universe is described as His body. In fact the two attributes - Lord of the universe and One who pervades this entire universe of moving and non-moving entities indicate that the Universe is not described as His body.

वि पु २-१६-२३   
which they mistake as an identity connecting Brahman, selves and jagat.   
"All this is One. What ever exists here, every tiny bit is that Achyuta. Nothing is more important than that. I am Him. You are that. All of this is Atmasvarūpa. Give up the illusory difference."   
Note the context and the meaing becomes very clear.   
The above verse means "He alone is the most important one in all things that exist. He is present in everything nad controls everything. He is called Achyuta as He is Indiminishable and undisplaceable. Nothing other than Him is independent and nothing is more important than Him. He is inside me and controls me and He is inside you and controls you. Thus He is Atma meaning Inner controller of all this. Stop seeing difference in His various forms. The illusory thinking that something other than Him can b independent has to be forsaken.".   
This is exactly like the Bhagavadgīta verse -

"The wise ones perceive non-difference among various forms of the Lord be it in the Brāhmaṇa, rich in knowledge and humility, or the cow, or the elephant, or a dog or a dog-eater."   
The Lord is always full, Independent and Immutable. Though the potencies of all the things and beings vary, His poetency is same in all - ever full.

Gītā - 4-

छान्दोग्य उपनिषत् - ३-१४-१   
is elaborated by statements like the above Gita verse and the above Viṣṇupurāṇa   
lines. Similar concept can be seen in many other places as well.   
In the above Visnupurāna (विष्णुपुराण), "sarvatra samabuddhi" (सर्वत्र समबुद्धि)   
(Equality of Lord's forms in all objects) is another concept to be noted. Those who have such right knowledge will head towards mokṣa, by forsaking anyathārūpa and obtaining nijarūpa, thru the grace of the Lord.   
All these extoll the Lord with no trace of śarīra śarīri bhāva (शरीर शरीरि भाव) .

The apparent meaning is   
"Due to the all-pervasiveness of the endless one, I exist as that only, Everything springs from me. I am every thing. Every thing is in me, the ancient one."   
Even Visiṣṭādvaita will not go with the apparent meaning. This is like Advaita only and in this prayer of Prahlada, the prior and latter verses and the context clearly indicate that it is not so. The real, correct and beautiful meaning is this.   
"Due to the Omnipresence of the Eternal one, He alone can exist as 'aham' śabdavācya. All this springs from Him, created by Him. He alone is the indweller and controller of every thing. He exists before deluge, during deluge and after deluge (hence known as sanātana) and everything resides in Him, seeking His support. In other words they take refuge in Him."   
Pūrvapaksa:   
There are some articles in various Sri Vaishnava sites on how Brahman is different from its body and kalyAna gunAs. Please search them out if you are interested.   
Siddhānta:   
If wishes were to become horses, the beggars would ride. Brahman is different from various objects and He is different from the universe, but none of these are His body. At the same time, He is non-different from His kalyāņa gunās. Otherwise what is God without those auspicious qualities? He need to be dependent on those.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
MAdhvAs have refuted archa avatara on the basis of their own assumptions that Brahman and its body are identical.   
Siddhanta:   
There are no assumptions. That is śāstra-siddha.   
Look what Sri Krishna says in Gīta   
—   
avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanumāśritam | paraṁ bhāvamajānanto mama bhūtamaheśvaram   
अवजानन्ति माम् मूढा मानुषीम् तनुमाश्रितम् ।   
परम् भावमजानन्तो मम भूतमहेश्वरम्॥   
Gitā 9-11   
गीता ९-११   
"The ignorant, not knowing my form correctly and not knowing that I am the embodiment of knowledge, bliss and full of attributes, disregard me thinking that like humans, I also acquire a body."   
The śruti vākya says   
-   
pūrṇamadaḥ pūrṇamidam pūrṇātpūrṇamudacyate | pūrṇasya pūrṇamādāya pūrṇamevāvaśiṣyate ||   
पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदम् पूर्णात्पूर्णमुदच्यते ।   
पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ॥   
"The Lord is all Full and all-infinite in His mūlarūpa (not needing a physical body) and in all His incarnations also He is infinite and Full of all auspicious attributes (not needing any physical body)."   
Taittiriya Upaniṣat says -   
"satyam jñānam anantam brahmā"(सत्यम् ज्ञानम् अनन्तम् ब्रह्मा)   
"The Lord is an embodiment of satya, jñāna and He is limitless".   
Thus His having a body or confined by a body is meaningless.   
More explanation and reasons for rejecting their idea of Archāvatara can be found further down.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
So, they ask, "How can you say the deity in temples is the Lord Himself, its equating matter with IsvarA". What they have failed to understand is that we differentiate between the Lord and His body.   
Siddhānta:   
From all the above śāstra pramāṇa-s, the Lord is to be taken as non- different from His body. The Visiṣṭādvaitins claim that the icon is actually the avatāra of the Lord and hence the icon is His body. Based on the above pramāṇa-s, when a question is put as to how can the jaḍa icon be equated to the Lord sinc e He is same as His body, they counter it by saying that they differentiate between the Lord and His body and so they are not equating the jaḍa icon with the Lord. That is like going from frying pan to fire. Now they have to answer all the above objections and also the objections that ensue   
(given further down).   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
The body is Suddha Sattvam, and such a Tattvam is not comprehended by MAdhvAs. The Kaushitaki Upanishad mentions Sri Vaikunta as a real place with trees, palaces, etc. These are made of suddha sattvam. Suddha Sattvam is also matter, but it is non-material matter, not prakrtic.   
Siddhanta:   
It is complete misconception on their part that either Madhvas have no concept of suddha satva or they do not agree that śuddha satva exists or they have no comprehension of śuddha satva. In several places such śuddha satva in vaikuṇṭha has been extensively referred.   
It is described as "aprākṛtika" and "divya".   
The issue is not acceptance of such a substance. The issue here is whether the vigraha (icon) is made of suddha satva.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
Sri Pillai LokAchAryA has mentioned that regarding the thirumeni of the Lord in temples as prakrtic is a great sin.   
Siddhānta:   
Thinking that the God has a body, be it suddha satva, is much greater sin.   
There is no scope for "svakapolakalpita" thoughts. Further look at the following problems they face. If vigraha is Lord's body, then   
Stagel: They faced the issue that Paramātma is jaḍa since there is no difference between Lord and His body.   
To get around that problem, they claimed that the Lord and His body are different and still the vigraha is His body.   
Stage2: Then they faced the issue that the vigraha, which is pancha bhūtatmaka prākṛtika jaḍa is His body.   
That is not acceptable and to get around that problem, they claimed that the vigraha is śuddha satva. Now this is worse, as they have to answer all the pramāṇa-s that declare that the God is non-different from His body and also they face the jaḍa being the body of the Lord.   
Stage3: Now they face the issue that the vigraha is still jaḍa (only relief that they get is that it is not prākṛtika). It is like saying "I dont want to be hit by a metal rod, but I want to be hit by a golden rod".   
Now they have to answer all the pramāṇa-s that declare that the God is non-different from His body and still answer how Lord can have a jaḍa body (a special jaḍa, surely). And this is still worse, because now they face the following issues as well.   
1. The śuddha satva is claimed to be in the liberated world (mokṣa only). Surely the Lord is Omnipotent and so He can bring śuddha satva into this world as well. But then there have to be pramāṇa-s, which declare that. It cannot be svakapolakalpita.   
2. Did the vigraha become suddha satva before the sculptor made the icon or after? If it is śuddha satva all the time, how could the sculptor make a vigraha by chiseling it? How was he able to sit on that vigarha while working on it? If it became suddha satva later on,   
how can the prākṛitik vigraha get transformed into aprākṛtik śuddha satva?   
3. Let us not even ask that question. Let us assume by some hook or crook, it became śuddha satva. Then we came across the instances, where muslims and other vandals destroyed the vigrahas. How were they able to destroy the suddha satva vigrahas?   
4. Śuddha satva is aprākṛtik and so no one should be able to see it. Let us assume that the Lord is so gracious that He allowed his devotees to see that. But then how could the vandals see it?   
5. Are the vigrahas of Viṣņu alone are śuddha satva or are the vigrahas of other deities also śuddha satva?   
6. After the destruction did the vigrahas remain as śuddha satva or change to non-śuddha-satva? Either way it is an issue.   
7. How come the Lord, with śuddha satva body does not even move around. Even the ordinary jīvas like all kinds of animals, humans and birds are able to move around with prākṛtik bodies, but the Lord with aprākṛtik body does not move around?   
8. Mahāvarāhapurāṇa says the following -   
anityatvam dehahāniḥ duḥkhaprāptirapūrṇatā | nāśaścaturvidhaḥ proktaḥ tadabhāvo hareḥ sadā | tadanyeṣāṁ tu sarveṣāṁ nāśāḥ kecidbhavanti hi ||   
अनित्यत्वम् देहहानिः दुःखप्राप्तिरपूर्णता ।   
Mahāvarāhapurāṇa   
नाशश्चतुर्विधः प्रोक्तः तदभावो हरेः सदा ।   
तदन्येषाम् तु सर्वेषाम् नाशाः केचिद्भवन्ति हि॥   
-   
महावराहपुराण   
"Destruction of self, Destruction of body, acqusition of sorrow, incompleteness are four kinds of destruction. Sri Hari does not have any of these. All the others have some kind of destruction."   
With the occasional destruction of the vigrahas, Sri Hari is now affected with one kind of destruction, namely destruction of body!!   
9. What is worse, the ordinary jīva after going to mokṣa, eventually gets free from bodily-destruction. However Sri Hari is eternally afflicted by this kind of bodily destruction. Thus in this aspect Sri Hari worse off than ordinary jīva!!   
10. Only Mula vigrahas in the temples are avatāras of the Lord or utsava vigrahas also avatāras of the Lord? Are both kinds made of śuddha sattva or only the Mula vigrahas are made of suddha sattva? What about the vigrahas that the devotees keep in their pūjā rooms? If people say "No, the vigrahas in the homes of the devotees are not   
avatāras of the Lord and so not śuddha satva", then they can contend that by protesting "regarding the thirumeni of the Lord in my pUja room as prakritic is a great sin."   
11. Why is the vigraha śuddha satvam - their argument is that it is so because the vigraha is śarIra of the Brahman and His śarIra has to be śuddha satvam. If that is their argument, they argue that this entire universe is śarIra of Brahman. So, this entire universe must be śuddha satva according to them.   
12. If the śarIra of Brahman has to be śuddha satva, then as per them the jiva is sarIra of Brahman and so the jīva must be suddha satva, meaning the jīva must be jaḍa according to them.   
They have to face so many issues. These expose their loose unsupported statements?   
Apart from lack of any pramāņa (except their own works), the enormous inconsistencies they face just debunk their statements of this kind.   
Remember one thing. In spite of the insignificant inert object, the Gracious God's grandeur graces that vigraha granting it the power to grant the mokṣa itself. That is what is called sannidhāna and the Lord gives and takes it out as per His will.   
So, instilling the imaginative fear in the minds of devotees by telling 'if one regards the icon/vigraha as non-incarnation of the Lord, it is a great sin', itself is a great sin as that is tantamount to attributing flaws to the Lord.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
The difference between a substance and its qualities does not regress to infinity because Sri Rāmānuja has stated that difference is an inherent nature of an attribute itself.   
Siddhānta:   
Sure. That is what is called viśeṣa.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
Vijayindra ParAjayA - Refutation of Ananda TAratamya   
MAdhvas believe that having entered into the supreme nature of Brahman, the liberated AtmA enjoys its bliss through themselves, as "mere attempts of intelligence".   
Siddhānta:   
That is wrong understanding. Madhvas believe "svatantram asvatantram cha dvividham tatvamiṣyate | svatantro bhagavān viṣṇuḥ"(स्वतन्त्रम् अस्वतन्त्रम् च द्विविधम् तत्वमिष्यते । स्वतन्त्रो भगवान् विष्णुः)   
Only Viṣṇu is independent. The liberated ātma enjoys its bliss through Bhagavān Viṣṇu, but as per its own yogyata only. There is no question of enjoying themselves.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Hence, they attempt to refute Vishishtadvaita as follows: The MuktAs do not have all the bliss that the Lord has. Each individual Self gets AnandA based on its own capacities. The MAdhvA provides the following example: just as by performing different sacrifices, different fruits are obtained, similarly, the JivAs, by performing different sAdhanAs, attain different types of pleasures in mokṣa. If Sri Rāmānuja admits Prapatti as an easier alternative to Bhakti, then the individuals attaining mokṣa by Bhakti would have greater anandA as compared to prapannas.   
Siddhānta:   
It is very important to understand that be it Bhakti or Prapatti, they are all tools for jñāna. The mokṣa comes only thru jñāna. The true jñāna will lead to proper bhakti and prapatti, etc. There is no objection to Bhakti or Prapatti, etc. The problem is if one claims that there is no need for jñāna; prapatti alone is sufficient to get mokṣa, that is objected to.   
"nānyah panthā ayanāya vidyate |" ( नान्यः पन्था अयनाय विद्यते   
1)   
"na hi jñānena sadrśam pavitramiha vidyate | " ( न हि ज्ञानेन सदृशम् पवित्रमिह विद्यते ।)   
"brahmavidāpnoti param | " (ब्रह्मविदाप्नोति परम् ।)   
"jñānenaiva param padam | " (ज्ञानेनैव परम् पदम् ।)   
|   
So Bhakti or Prapatti without jñāna will not lead to mokṣa.   
And every body does not have same amount of jñāna.   
jñānatāratamya (ज्ञानतारतम्य) is indicative of yogyatātāratamya ( योग्यतातारतम्य ) .   
.   
jñānatāratamya leads to bhaktitäratamya (HR), which in turn leads to   
Anandatāratamya (आनन्दतारतम्य).   
"tadbhaktitāratamyena tāratamyam vimuktigam | " (तद्भक्तितारतम्येन तारतम्यम् विमुक्तिगम् । )   
No other way out.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
MAdhvAs further assert that if the Vishishtadvaita view of equal AnandA is followed, then it means the JivA has equal status to Brahman. This is against the ShAstrAs.   
Siddhanta:   
Ambiguity and onfusion can corrode correct knowledge. Please consider the following   
Equal Ananda of muktas compared to God. Jiva has equal status to Brahman.   
—   
- S2   
If Sl is followed, then it means that S2 is true. Mādhvas assert S3.   
- S4   
This is against śāstras.   
- S5   
Let us analyze the above claim of Visiṣṭādvaita.   
-   
S1   
—   
- S3   
What is meant by S2?   
What does "This" in S5 refer to? If "This" refers to S2, then what is   
S2?   
Where is the support for this kind of assertion?   
What is the issue Visiṣṭādvaita is facing? If it does not agree to $2 and it has problem with S3, then it is not the question of śāstra here, but it is a question of inference here.   
Further Madhvas need neither S2 nor S3 to reject S1. There is plenty of scope to reject S1 by itself using scriptural support.   
If by “status", "status of bliss" is meant, then S1 and S2 become synonymous and S3 becomes trivially true. There is no need for S4 at all. Madhvas reject S1 without going for S2, S3 or S4.   
If by “status", "position or power" is meant, even then Madhvas reject S1 without going for S2, S3 or S4. There is no need for S2, S3 and S4 to reject S1.   
COMMENT: Are the purvapaxins just doing anuvada of the Dvaita side?   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Furthermore, how can the JivA have equal AnandA with Sri Hari when the Brahma SutrAs say it does not possess some powers such as creation, etc. which Sri Hari possesses?   
Siddhanta:   
Again a wrong vyapti. It is not   
—   
Jīva does not possess powers such as creation, etc. ==> Hence jiva cannot have equal Ananda.   
The reasons for jīva not having equal ananda arises from scriptures itself. Also that is the most logical thing.   
Not only that, creation, maintenance, destruction, control, giving knowledge, ignorance, bondage, liberation are additional tasks.   
So, the Lord does all this and gets certain Ananda. Then the mukta jīva does not do any of these, but still gets same Ananda as Brahman. This is like saying one person toils day and night and gets a salary of million dollars. Another one does not do anything, but still gets a million dollars. Then the situation of the latter is much better than the former. Is it not? That is weird too.   
COMMENT: Are the purvapaxins just doing anuvada of the Dvaita side?   
Pūrvapaksa:   
The PramAnA for the gradation in mokṣa for MAdhvAs is the Anandavalli of the Taittiriya Up., which measures the bliss enjoyed by manushyAs, GandharvAs, DevAs, etc.   
Siddhānta:   
And also Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣat. This will be discussed in detail later   
on.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
ParakAla Yati refutes this view. Based on their Seshatva SvarUpa, the jīva does not enjoy its own bliss. It enjoys the bliss of Brahman. The state of mokṣa is not Self-Realisation (called Kaivalya ) but it's the realization of Bhagavad SvarUpa.   
Siddhānta:   
That goes against the following pramāņa-s.   
OM sampadyāvihāya svena śabdāt OM

The mukti is nothing but forsaking what is not inherent and enjoying one's own inherent nature (without forsaking the Lord).

"Just like the four Vayu, Brahma, Bhārati and Sarasvati, the jīva forsakes his body by the grace of the Lord, reaches the Paramjyoti Paramātma and attains svarūpAnanda āvirbhāva".   
Note that when it is said that the jīva enjoys its own inherent bliss, even that svarūpa ānanda āvirbhāva happens only from the grace of the Lord. Kaivalya or Self-realization is "Realization of the Supreme self". The mukta jīva revels in the darśana ānanda of the Supreme Lord. That itself is inherent to the mukta jīva.   
Further there is heavy confusion in the usage of the expression   
"realization".   
Realize can mean "being aware of" or "comprehend". It can also mean "acquire" or "attain".   
The jiva can comprehend the Lord to the extent of its ability. But the jīva can not have the entire bliss of the Lord. The jīva cannot also comprehend the Lord completely (yato vaacho nivartante aprāpya manasā saha) - this is applicable in mokṣa also. If the jīva cannot comprehend the Lord fully, then where is the question of having the same bliss as the Lord?

They should have atleast read the commentary of their own Acharya. While commenting on the verse 15-16 of Gita, Sri Rāmānuja says   
akṣaraśabdanirdiṣṭaḥ kūṭasthaḥ acitsaṁsargaviyuktaḥ svena rūpeņa avasthito muktātmā |   
Rāmānujabhāṣya for Gītā 15-

"The liberated soul, termed as akṣara, is also termed as kūṭastha, for having no contact with insentient, remains in its own form. (enjoying his own bliss, even though controlled by Paramātma)."   
—   
The jiva enjoys the bliss thru the Lord the bimba-pratibimba bhāva continues even in mokṣa. The jīva does not enjoy the bliss of the Lord. One must be careful in using proper expression.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
ParakAla Yati states that the Taittiriya Upanishad refers to BaddhAs with difference in dharma bhūta jñānA while declaring their relative anandA. Therefore, the MAdhvA theory that such differences in AnandA pertain to mokṣa is wrong.   
Siddhānta:   
Both Taittirīya Upaniṣat and Chāndogya Upaniṣat clearly say that it pertains to mokṣa only. Even simple common sense and logical thinking will tell that it can only be in mokṣa. It cannot refer to baddhas. It will be explained later on in detail. The kind of DBJ (dharma buta jnana) spoken of is non-existent, anti-scriptural and irrational and so cannot be supported and is to rejected completly.   
The Vrittijñāna that is pertinent to saMsāra is quite acceptable, but that will be cast off at the time of liberation.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Since the dharma bhūta jñānA is expanded infinitely for all Jīvas in mokṣa, there is equal cognition of Brahman"s kalyAna gunAs for all, and hence, equal enjoyment, implying also that all JivAs are identical in SvarUpA.   
Siddhanta:   
To start with there is no scriptural statement that supports "dharma- bhūta-jñāna" (DBJ). Further there is no scriptural statement that speaks of its expansion. Much less is the scope for "infinite expansion". There is no end to the assumptions. Next assumption is that a mukta jīva gets the cognition of Brahman's kalyāṇa guṇa-s completely (as much as Brahman Himself or else there is no scope for ānanda sāmya). Next assumption is that all the mukta jīvas get equal cognition of Brahman's kalyāṇa guṇa-s implying all get full cognition of all the kalyaṇa guṇa-s of the Lord. Next assumption is that all the mukta jīvas get equal enjoyment. Next assumption is that this enjoyment of all the jīvas equals that of Brahman Himself.   
For accomplishing this impossible thing, a non-existent dhama bhūta jñāna is used. It is supposed to continue into mokṣa to accomplish the above impossible things. This is akin to bringing lot of hare's horns, then paint them with different colors and then using them to build the machines that make all the humans equally strong.   
The continuation of DBJ into mokṣa is not only unsupported, but it goes against scriptures. "na pretya samjñā asti" (Nothing other than svarūpajñāna, is carried to mokṣa). Later on this concept of DBJ will be refuted completely.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
To quote from the Vijayindra ParAjayA,   
"The differences in bliss experienced by the said entities (manushya, gandharva, deva, etc.) in the Anandavalli are primarily due to expansions and contractions of their intelligence (dharma bhūta jñānA), based on karma and do not pertain to the state of mokṣa."   
Siddhānta:   
A non-existent, anti-scriptural and irrational concept of DBJ is used in an irrational, anti-scriptural and inconsistent way   
(expansions and contractions of DBJ, leading to variations of bliss in saMsāra, but equality of bliss in mokṣa) to force-fit a ridiculous and anti-scriptural concept of ananda-sāmya in mokṣa, by ignoring the explicitly stated expressions in scriptures that emphatically declare that the discussion is for muktas only.

If one sees the prior "rk", it is obvious that the stage is set to describe the gradation of bliss in liberation. It is said earlier on   
"atha_so.abhayam gato bhavati |" (अथ सोऽभयम् गतो भवति । ) ( Now he acquires   
a kind of fearless state and reaches the fearless Lord). If there is still confusion in the minds of the readers, that is expelled in the above "xk".   
One hundred bliss units of Mukta chakravartis = one bliss unit of mukta Manuşya Gandharvas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravaṇa phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become āptakāmas).   
One hundred bliss units of Mukta Manuṣya Gandharvas = one bliss unit   
of mukta Deva Gandharvas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravana phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become āptakāmas).   
One hundred bliss units of Mukta Deva Gandharvas = one bliss unit of mukta pitṛ devatas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravana phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become aptakāmas).   
One hundred bliss units of Mukta pitṛ devatas = one bliss unit of mukta ajānaja devatas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravaṇa phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become āptakāmas).   
One hundred bliss units of Mukta ajānaja devatas = one bliss unit of mukta karmaja devatas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravaṇa phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become aptakāmas).   
and then it continues from Mukta Karmaja devatas to Mukta devatas, etc. upto Chaturmukha Brahma.   
Note that in each case, the two words "śrotriyasya" and "akāmahatasya" are repeated tirelessly to avoid any confusion and to emphasize that this is "ānanda mīmāMsa of mukta jīvas only, not amukta jīvas.

Note in the above, raddha is applicable to Muktas only.   
The term "śrotriya" means one who obtained the full fruit of veda adhyayana.   
This can truly apply to muktas only.   
avṛjina one who devoid of sorrow   
akāmahata   
=   
āpta kāmas (whose desire never remains unfulfilled).   
These are applicable to muktas only.   
Did they really miss these terms?   
Of course, some may start arguing "Oh Sanskrit is such a flexible language; we can interpret these terms differently". The important thing is that one should go for such alternate interpretations if the rūḍhyartha or prasiddha artha gives problems.   
Also the alternate interpretation should not lead to other difficulties. To reject a problem-less rūḍhyartha and to resort to an implausible explanation is not wise at all. Such an approach can only happen for those with pūrvāgraha.   
Even if this wish be granted for just a minute to see if that helps them in any way. If the above only applies to amukta/baddha jīvas, then the very next question that comes to our mind is - "OK, this account is for all amukta jīvas - why should the śrutis come and tell us what happens in amukta state, which can be gauged much more easily than in mukta state? Ok, let us say that Vedas wanted to express this amukta position any way. Then right after that to remove all the confusion, the śruti vākyas can say one most important and most required statement "...but in mukti, the levels of ānanda of all the mukta jīvas are equal and equal to that of the Brahman.".   
No such statement can be seen, not right after those statements and nowhere in śrutis. Truly their position is untenable.   
Another big problem with that assumption that the śruti vākya is saying ānanda tāratamya for amuktas is this. The joy for amuktas is ever-fluctuating and so what point of time is that tāratamya addressing? After Vritrāsura vadha, Indra was highly depressed. At that point of time, some other insignificant jīva may be having a great joy. So, the joy of that insignificant jīva is higher than Indra at that point of time. So, how will that śruti statement apply? It does not make any sense if that statement speaks of a situation, where there is lot of fluctuation. It makes lot of sense when that speaks of a situation where a "level of constancy" is reached. That happens only in mokṣa. If the gradation is for muktas, there is absolutely no difficulty.   
And the Brahman has to do all the activities and yet the mukta jīvas, who dont do any thing will reap the same bliss of the Lord, who does all the work. It is not ānanda samya, but anandavaiṣamya. The Brahman is much worse off than all the mukta jīvas. What is worse, according to Viśiṣṭādvaita, even those who hate the Lord all the time obtain mukti only. So, even they get the same ānanda as the Brahman. The ānanda or bliss experienced by their own Acharya after he goes to mukti is same as the ānanda reaped by "Kalipuruṣa" and the jīva in the grass and in the ant after they go to mokṣa.   
Ananda Samya is nothing but a disastrous position.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
{Special Note: MAdhvA recognizes only the knower and the object of knowledge.   
Siddhanta:   
Completely wrong. Can they show any statement that supports their position. Do they really claim that Madhvācārya knows only jñātṛ and jñeya, but has no awareness of jñāna? I don't know what they are trying to say?   
Pūrvapaksa:   
But Sri Rāmānuja recognizes 3 entities know' and the object of knowledge'.   
Siddhānta:   
—   
knower, the attribute 'to   
Multiple problems in their approach. This kind of arguments are called "run-away arguments or wandering arguments or strawmanarguments". They make claims that cannot be justified. Secondly even those claims do not come to their rescue as will be proved later on. Just because there are jñātṛ, jñeya and jñāna, that will not help in claiming DBJ. If they are referring to 'indriya janya or antaḥkaraṇastha vṛtti jñāna", then such is extensively mentioned and held in Madhva Siddhānta. But that Vritti jñāna goes away when one goes to mokṣa, as the jaḍa indriyas are gone. Svarūpajñāna alone remains.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Example: A gem possesses innate radiance. This is svarUpa jñānA. But it also has a radiance that spreads from it, illuminating other objects. This is called dharma bhūta jñānA. When the gem is covered by dust, the spread of radiance will be less, but its innate radiance is intact.   
Siddhanta:   
Let us eliminate confusion here. The diamond has the following property. All these are inherent to it.   
It has innate radiance. This innate radiance itself has the following properties -   
—   
1. It reacts to external light. The brighter the external light, the greater its dazzling, reflecting the light and shining forth.   
2. Its capacity to reflect the light depends on its own capacity and also the non-interference another substance like mud, dust or a dark paper wrap, etc.   
3. In pitch dark, where not even dim light is there, not even ultraviolet light or the like there, it has not got anything to reflect.   
4. Even after the removal of dust, etc, there is no scope for infinite light emanating from the gem.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Similarly, a JivA (analogous to gem) under karmA (analogous to dust), has less dharma bhūta jñānA (analogous to spreading radiance), but its svarUpa jñānA (innate radiance) is intact. In the state of mokṣa, karma is cleansed just like dust is removed from a gem, and all jivAs have their dharma bhūta jñānA expanded infinitely.   
Siddhānta:   
The light of this gem will not exceed the light of the Sun. (note   
that even the light of the Sun is not infinite and it relies on the Lord)   
yadādityagataṁ tejo jagadbhāsayate'khilam | yaccandramasi yaccāgnau tattejo viddhi māmakam ||

Gītā 15-12   
गीता १५-१२   
"The shining power in the Sun that illuminates the world, the shining power in moon and in fire are all mine" so says the Lord.   
That being the case, why this wild conjecture of infinite expansion?   
Where does this DBJ come from? Is that inherent to jīva or not? Where is its locus? Does it continue into mukti state? Why should it expand infinitely? If it is not inherent to jīva, what stops its being lost? If that has such an extra-ordinary capacity to make each jiva, even as insignificant as a bacteria to have infinite bliss in mokṣa, then a source of such tall and big claim must not only find an explicit place in scriptures, but must have been repeated and emphasized many places as that is a very critical element, since it is removing the flaw of apūrṇata in the jīvas and bringing it in par with Brahman Himself.   
Each gem reflects different amount of light. Each luminous object has its own capacity. The moon reflects a lot of light. Each lamp has different light. The light bulbs have varying capacity. The sun's light exceeds that of all these. God's lustre is infinitely more than that. It does not even make sense to compare the glow of any jīva with that of the Lord. Even after going to mokṣa, not only the jīva is dependent on the Lord, the jīva is amazed seeing the brightness of the Lord. The mukta jīvas being equal to Brahman is unsupported.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
This is supported by Upanishadic vAkyAs like Svayam PrakAsatvam of AtmA, ie, AtmA reveals itself by itself (svarUpa) and illumines other objects (dharma bhūta jñānA.   
Siddhanta:   
If jīva has svayam prakāśatva, that is fine. If there is a claim that jīva is jñāna ānāndātmaka, that is accepted. If there is svarūpa ānanda abhivyakti in mokṣa, that is fine. Where is the usage of DBJ in Upaniṣats? What other equivalent word is used? If such DBJ makes jīva become equal to Brahman, there must have been several statements explaining that, since that is an extra-ordinary claim. Where are those bold statements?   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Also, 'He who knows Brahman becomes Brahman'. Here, JivA is called Brahman because of its great dharma bhūta jñānA, expanded on knowing ParamAtmA. 'Brahman' means that which grows great, and the jivA's jñānA is great.}   
Siddhānta:   
If some one says that a person who joins Micrsoft becomes a micrsoft person, it is pretty obvious that every employee will not become the "Microsoft company" itself or become equal to the "microsoft company". That being the case, where is the question of a jīva that reaches Brahman (in mokṣa) become Brahman Himself or become equal to Brahman? One must arrive at the meaning based on the context.   
The continuation of DBJ into mokṣa is not only unsupported, but it goes against scriptures. "na pretya samjñā asti" (ŞI 3⁄4ÎTA) (Nothing other than svarūpajñāna, is carried to mokṣa).

The meaning hidden there has to be understood properly. While Advaitins interpreted this to mean that jīva becomes Brahman, Viśiṣṭādvaitins interpreted that to mean that jīva becomes equal to   
Brahman.   
One can get proper meaning from skaṁdapurāṇa () words (as quoted by Acharya). Note that one does not become Brahman nor become equal to Brahman.

"One who knows Parabrahma, becomes full of jñāna ānanda, etc as per one's own yogyata. He cannot acquire even a tiny bit more than his own yogyata. Then where is the question of his acquiring Sri Hari's guṇa-s? Jīvas acquiring Brahmatva or Bṛṁhitatva means as per their yogyata, they become full; it does not mean that they become paramātma or equal to Paramātma. Paramātma is always solely all- independent. How can the ever-dependent jīva acquire independence?   
Look at what Sri Rāmānuja says while commenting on verses 16-18 of 15th Adhyāya of Gīta

रामानुजभाष्य- १५-१६, १५-१७, १५-१८   
"The liberated soul, termed as akşara, is also termed as kūtastha, for having no contact with insentient, remains in its own form. (enjoying his own bliss, even though controlled by Paramātma). The Supreme Being, one Who is distinct from both unliberated and liberated souls, and known as Paramātma, is much higher than them. Thus by the stated inherent natures, and for the stated reasons, I am very much greater and for that reason, both in loka and veda, I am known as Purusottama".   
Thus even wrt the jīvas in liberation, the Lord is infinitely greater and equality of any kind between jīva and God is to be discareded by their own school. Sri Parakāla yati appears to have gone against his own Acharya.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
ParakAla Yati asserts that only the baddhAtmAs show gradations and differences in enjoyment due to the contraction and expansion of the dharma bhūta jñānA.   
Siddhanta:   
It has been described extensively how śrutis clearly indicated that gradation of enjoyment pertains to muktātmās only, but not baddhātmās. Also it was explained earlier how the assertion that it pertains to baddhātmās leads to absurd conclusions. How can any one claim that the śruti speaks of gradation of ānanda in an ever- fluctuating saMsāra that too of the devatas and keeps completely silent of what happens to muktātmās, when actually a constancy (steady state) is reached?   
Pūrvapaksa:   
The muktAs are constantly under the control of Sriman NArAyaNa and they derive their bliss only from Sriman NArAyaNa by doing kainkaryam and experiencing His kalyAna gunAs.   
Siddhanta:   
Sure. Muktas are under the control of Sriman Nārāyaṇa. They derive their bliss only from Sriman Nārāyaṇa by doing kainkaryam. Sure. What does it mean by "experiencing His kalyāṇa guṇa-s". Does it mean they meditate upon those and derive bliss? Then that is fine too. How will any of these help? As stated earlier, it appears that this mixture of good and bad ideas is to support an ultimately incorrect concept.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Also, BhagavAn has infinite dharma bhūta jñānA as well.   
Siddhanta:   
Where is this mentioned? It is obvious that the jñāna of the Lord is infinite. That is His svarūpajñāna itself. Why does he need this ever-dubious, non-existing and never-mentioned jñāna? Is thsi jñāna pertinent to saMsāra? If so, the Lord never has any saMsāra? Obviously this is not same as svarūpajñāna. What is it? Where is it   
mentioned? An imaginary role of making the non-existent dharma bhuta jnana as an equalizer between jīva and Brahman is incredulous.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
But for him, there is no contraction or expansion of His jñānA, and he is eternally free of karma.   
Siddhanta:   
To illustrate the mixyure of good and bad ideas, consider that this is like saying "He brought the hare's horn and put it on his table." The hare's horn is non-existing, but the table is real. In the same sentence, imaginary and real thngs are spoken of.   
—   
"there is no contraction or expansion of His jñānA" what jñāna – if it is svarūpajñāna, then that is fine (as He is avikāri). If it is DBJ, then like a hare's horn, it is non-existent.   
"he is eternally free of karma." denies it.   
—   
—   
Absolutely no vedic thought   
Pūrvapaksa:   
His svarUpa jñānA and dharma bhūta jñānA both are all-pervading.   
Siddhanta:   
Again, one real and one imaginary thing are brought in. DBJ is non- existent. if the dhama bhūta jñāna of the mukta jīva is also infinite (because of infinite expansion), then like DBJ of Paramātma, the DBJ of every mukta jīva must also be all-pervading. That is totally wrong and not mentioned in any scripture.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
And while BhagavAn is 'avikArA' and His svarUpA does not undergo any changes, being Satyam, jñānam, Anantam, Anandam and Amalatvam, the dharma bhūta jñānA of bhagavAn undergoes transformations and manifests itself as the kalyAnA gunAs we know and love.   
Siddhanta:   
Let us review this conglomeration. One needs to separate the wheat from the chaff.   
"while Bhagavān is 'avikārĀ' and His svarūpa does not undergo any changes, being Satyam, jñānam, Anantam, Anandam and Amalatvam" Absolutely fine.   
-   
"the dharma-bhūta-jñānA of bhagavān undergoes transformations" First of all where is this DBJ mentioned? Secondly, the danger in bringing all these concepts which have absolutely no support in any scripture is that more often than not, they fail to handle these extraneous concepts and end up losing consistency.   
It was mentioned earlier   
—   
"there is no contraction or expansion of His jñānA" - this is an   
indication of absence of Vikara.   
—   
"the dharma bhūta jñānA of bhagavAn undergoes transformations" this is an indication of Vikara.   
" while BhagavAn is 'avikArA' and His svarUpA does not undergo any changes, being Satyam, jñānam, Anantam, Anandam and Amalatvam"   
(1)   
the dharma bhūta jñānA of bhagavAn undergoes transformations and manifests itself as the kalyAnA gunAs"   
—   
(2)   
Satyam, jñānam, Anantam, Anandam and Amalatvam Are these kalyāņa guņa-s or not?   
(1) links them with Svarupa jñāna and (2) links them with DBJ (dharmabhūtajñāna).   
—   
"the kalyAnA gunAs we know and love." Surely we Love. One good way to know them properly is not to link them with DBJ, which is like a hare's horn. They must first come to a conclusion as to where the seat for these kalyāṇa guņa-s is - Svarūpa jñāna or DBJ ?   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Hence, the auspicious attributes of Brahman are simply different states of His dharma bhūta jñānA.   
Siddhānta:   
All the auspiciousness is shattered by calling them to be the states of an unsupported, non-scriptural and non-existing entity. When we know them to be auspicious, it is highly desirable to discard such dangerous assignments.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
SrinivAsAchAryA explains it in Yatindra Mata DIpikA.   
Siddhānta:   
Why is not mentioned in śāstras.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Furthermore, having shown that the object of enjoyment is Brahman and not the intrinsic bliss of the Self (as imagined by the mAdhvAs),   
Siddhānta:   
When ice cream is the object of enjoyment for a person, no one thinks that the ice cream is the person. If they think like that or if they think that others think like that, the problem only lies with them. Surely, the person gets the joy, not the ice cream. It is high-time to snap out of all this confusion.   
"naija sukhānubhūti" means that anubhava is for the jiva only. Is there any doubt about that? There are extensive descriptions of mokṣa in Madhva śāstra. Is it mentioned anywhere that the muktas do not enjoy Brahman's company?   
Pūrvapaksa:   
it is impossible to state a gradation in bliss because Brahman by His very nature is homogenous and cannot be divided into parts (Neha NAnAsti Kincana).   
Siddhānta:   
If "Brahman by His very nature is homogenous and cannot be divided into parts (Neha NAnAsti Kincana)", how and why will the bliss of all the other jīvas become equal to that of Brahman ?   
Isn't it also important to realize that the Lord is greater than all the akṣaras also?   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Hence, enjoyment of Brahman would result in equal AnandA for all.   
Siddhanta:   
This is like saying "It is impossible to state a gradation of financial strength of all Microsoft employees, because Microsoft is financially strong. Hence employment in Microsoft would result in equal financial strength for all its employees and each employee will have same fiancial strength of Microsoft."   
The example is only to drive the pint. The flaw in the conclusion like that is very obvious. But to understand the flaw in things that   
are beyond pratyakṣa, the scriptures are the guide. If one starts discarding the scriptures by saying things like "oh, those statements are for baddha jīvas.", that is simply disastrous.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Lastly, the objection that jivAs have limited capacities and hence, cannot enjoy Brahman's infinite gunAs to maximum extent is negated by the fact that dharma bhūta jñānA is infinitely expanded in mokṣa.   
Siddhānta:   
By waving the magic wand of DBJ made of hare's horn, if such impossible conclusions are drawn, then there is no end to such wild conjectures at all. If this magic wand can be used to draw an absurd conclusion that all the mukta jīvas have the same ānanda, the same magic wand can be used by some one to draw more absurd conclusion that "DBJ expands in reverse of svarūpa jñāna and so the most insignificant creature in saMsāra will have greatest bliss in mokṣa and the greatest being in saMsāra will have the least bliss in mokṣa, which is lot more than the bliss of the Lord as His DBJ will contract maximum" - real crazy approach - but where is the end for such wild conjectures? In matters of such great importance, let us not bring in concepts that are not supported in scriptures, that too that go against common sense as well as against scriptures.   
The absurdities of accepting DBJ have been extensively explained earlier on and there is no point in repeating them here. Calling them as facts will not make them facts. They have to be supported by scriptures and/or stand the scrutiny of logic and consistency. As pointed out this DBJ is leading them to self-contradictions leave alone other issues.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
ParakAla Yati gives an analogy. Just as a wife who is totally dependent on her husband and enjoys whatever her husband does, the JivA enjoys Brahman's svarUpa-rUpa-gunA-vibhUti. He adds that since Brahman enjoying His own gunAs as well, there is sAmyam in AnandA between Brahman and JivA.   
Siddhānta:   
The more the attempt at justification, the deeper th trouble. Too many flaws.   
1. It is hard to find a wife, who enjoys what ever her husband does.   
Let us assume that there is some wife, who actually enjoys what ever her husband does.   
2. It is against our pratyakṣa that both of them will have same joy. There is no mandate that any two individuals must have same joy.   
3. The husband also should enjoy what ever his wife does. That is just as the wife is pativrata, the husband must be a patnivrata. Even then there is no guarantee that their joys will be equal or same.   
4. How can the joy of doing an action and the joy of approving that action be the same?   
5. Here the example has another huge flaw in that, it is taking into account two almost similarly placed beings. That does not expose the seriousness of the situation. Then?   
6. Let us take the instance of Sri Ramachandra, when He ruled the Earth. A very ordinary person, or an ordinary animal or an ordinary bird in His kingdom approved all the actions of Sri Rama. Does that mean that the joy of that person, animal or bird is same as the joy of Sri Rama chandra?   
7. If the objection is that the example is not talking about Mukti, the wife and husband example is also not in Mukti. Sri Rama and his subject's example is much more realistic and hits right on our face the absurdity of ānanda sāmya based on such frivolous examples and such horrible reasoning.   
Why would "the JivA enjoys Brahman's svarUpa-rUpa-gunA-vibhuti. He adds that since Brahman enjoying His own gunAs as well," mean that "there is sAmyam in AnandA between Brahman and JivA."   
Even assuming (just for a minute) that they get their joys from the same source, how can one conclude that they get equal joy? Just because an elephant and a tiny animal get the water from the same lake, would any one conclude that they drink same amount of water? What kind of logic is that?   
Where is it mentioned that every mukta jīva gets knows every thing about every guņa of the Brahman?   
If ānanda-sāmya were true, then in addition to the following   
expressions   
satyam jñānamamantam brahma |   
सत्यम् ज्ञानममन्तम् ब्रह्म ।   
vijñānamānandam brahma |   
विज्ञानमानन्दम् ब्रह्म।yaḥ sarvajñaḥ sarvavid yasya jñānamayam tapaḥ | (for Brahman)   
यः सर्वज्ञः सर्वविद् यस्य ज्ञानमयम् तपः ।   
there should also be following expressions   
satyam jñānamamantam muktaḥ |   
सत्यम् ज्ञानममन्तम् मुक्तः ।   
vijñānamānandam muktaḥ |   
विज्ञानमानन्दम् मुक्तः।   
—   
yaḥ sarvajñaḥ sarvavid yasya jñānamayam tapaḥ | (for mukta)   
यः सर्वज्ञः सर्वविद् यस्य ज्ञानमयम् तपः ।   
They are just not there,   
Pūrvapaksa:   
(Special Note: This also refutes the MAdhvA's view that Vishishtadvaita believe in equal 'status' of JivA with Brahman in   
mokṣa.   
Siddhanta:   
How can the jīva be much less in ānanda equal to Brahman? Even   
Jñāna and ananda are indicative of status and the status is indicative of jñāna and ānanda. status and still have jñāna and granting that such is possible, the problem is not with the status. The problem is that in any guņa, the jīva cannot even come any where near to God. That is given.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
The paramam sAmyam sruti states that JivA becomes equal in 6 gunas with Brahman. jñānA and AnandA, as explained here, are two.   
Siddhānta:   
-   
This is another wild conjecture the śruti vākya goes   
yadā paśyaḥ paśyate rukmavarṇaṁ kartāramīśam puruşaṁ brahmayonim | tadā vidvān puṇyapāpe vidhūya nirañjanaḥ paramaṁ sāmyamupaiti ||   
Taittiriya 3-1-3||   
—   
यदा पश्यः पश्यते रुक्मवर्णम् कर्तारमीशम् पुरुषम् ब्रह्मयोनिम्।

तैत्तिरीय ३-१-३   
"   
"When the jīva sees the golden effulgent Paramātma, the creator of the universe, ever-full in all guṇa-s, father of Chaturmukha Brahma, that aparokṣa jñāni gets rid of aniṣṭa aprārabdha punya and aprārabdha pāpa, untouched by future sins, similar to the Brahman, obtains svarūpa-sukha abhivyakti (manifestation of inherent bliss).'   
There is no mention of becoming equal in six guņa-s. The context clearly indicates that it is only similarity. When one sees the entire canon of śrutis and smṛtis, it is quite evident that the jīva can never equal Paramātma.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
The JIvA is also Satya Sankalpan, since he only wants to serve Brahman,   
Siddhānta:   
Not just because he wants to serve Brahman, the jīva becomes "Satya Sankalpa". If that were the case, then many amuktas/baddha jīvas, who want to serveBrahman wouldhave become "Satya sankalpa". The jīva becomes Satya sankalpa because he/she completed the sādhana and the Lord found the right time to grant mokṣa and the "satya sankalpatva". Still this "satya sankalpatva" of the jīva is dependent on the Lord.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
and Brahman is also Satya Sankalpan, since he has taken a vow to protect JivAs.   
Siddhānta:   
Not just because the Lord has taken a vow to protect jīvas, He becomes "Satya Sankalpa". He is independent and eternally He is satya sankalpa and sarva svatantra.   
One should not have such mix-ups.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
The JivA is also Satya KAman, since all his desires are fulfilled by Brahman. The desire is merely kainkaryam and anubhavam of BhagavAn. Brahman is, naturally, Satya KAman.   
Siddhānta:   
Just because both are satyasankalpa, just because both are jñāna ānanda ātmaka, concluding that they have equal bliss is similar to the following.   
X says "I and Y bot of us have bank accounts and so we are equal financially". In reality X has a few bucks in the account and Y has several billion dollars in the account. So, what is there in the account matters and not just the name or kind.   
Can every mukta jīva because of "satya kāmatva" and his desire to do kainkaryam, wish for the opportunity to do the 8 kinds of vyāpāra "jagat sriṣṭi, sthiti, laya, niyamana, etc" as kainkaryam of Bhagavān?   
Pūrvapaksa:   
The JivA is also decorated with BrahmAlankAram, as described by the Kaushitaki Upanishad, hence, this is another sAmyam.   
Siddhanta:   
Sure. That is another similarity. Four kinds of mukti are described in śāstras   
Sāyujya, Sārūpya, Sālokya and Sāmipya. What they are referring is sārūpya. They may also have similar vaibhoga. All are similar only. No equal things. One who is only for kainkaryam even think of equality?   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Note that in all cases, the jivA does not achieve anything by his own will or effort. Everything is given by Brahman to the jivA, making the jivA totally dependent on Brahman. Hence, no sAmyam in 'status' as alleged by MAdhvAs.)   
Siddhānta:   
In the above example of X and Y, X may say "I am always dependent on Y and so we are not equal in status, but we are equal financially", despite X having just a few dollars and Y having several billion dollars.   
Let them forget about the status. It is perfectly fine, if they also agree that the Lord is much above the jiva in status. The question is about the absurd claim that the mukta jīva equals Paramātma in six qualities.   
"No sāmyam" in anything including status. There are no exceptions. The word omniscient is applicable to the Lord only and not to the   
mukta jīvas. Is that so hard to get? How can the jīva be equal to the Lord in jñāna and ānanda ?   
Pūrvapaksa:   
The MAdhvAs believe that there are different kinds of AnandA, and hence, grades of enjoyment in mokṣa. The Vijayindra ParAjayA refutes this view, stating that only Brahman and nothing else is enjoyed in mokṣa.   
Siddhanta:   
Bhagavata does speak of kinds of mokṣa like Sayujya, sārūpya, sālokya and sāmīpya.   
The śruti vākyas that speak of gradation of bliss pertains to muktas only, but not baddha-s.   
Sri Parakālayati's statements have to be discarded based on following Chandogya Upaniṣat statements.

"Vāyu, Brahma, Bharati and Sarasvathi have no śarira abhimāna. Just like these four forsake their bodies by the grace of the Lord, reach Paramjyoti Paramātma and attain svarūpa ānanda āvirbhāva, the jīva also by the grace of the Lord, forsakes the body, reaches Paramjyoti Paramātma and attains svarūpa ānanda āvirbhāva. These liberated ones, by the grace of the Lord, in there (Vaikuntha), they eat, do Vihāra, move about with their women, move in vehicles with those who got mukti along with them and also those who got mukti earlier on.   
Because of their absorption in Bhagavān's darśana ānanda, they forget themselves and others. The Lord only gives this svarūpa ānanda āvirbhāva and appoints Mukhyprāṇa as his charioteer."   
Pūrvapaksa:   
The Vijayindra ParAjaya goes on to state that the example of different sacrifices yielding different pleasures cannot be compared to mokṣa. Because the objects of those sacrifices are different from one another and also are attained by performing bodily acts. Whereas the object of all upAyAs here is Brahman only, achievable only by bhakti and hence, there cannot be any grades in degree of bliss due to "less bhakti" or "more bhakti" since Brahman is homogenous. Mukti is available for all, and only Brahman is the source of enjoyment for all as well.   
Siddhanta:   
Why can't the 'example of different sacrifices yielding different pleasures be compared to mokṣa' ? Isn't the object of all the sacrifices God? That being the case, how can the objects of those sacrifices be different? Aren't the sacrifices based on vedas? They have to note the Kathopaniṣat vākya   
sarve vedā yatpadamāmananti

—   
Kathopaniṣat 1-2-15   
- कठोपनिषत् - १-२-१५   
"All the vedas extoll the Lord's svarūpa."   
Do they think that Bhakti is not needed for performing the sacrifices   
?   
The grammatical structure of this writer is terribly flawed and leads to lot of ambiguity as well. Ambiguity and confusion are the easiest shelter sought by those, who have very weak position.   
Look at this sentence   
—   
"Whereas the object of all upAyAs here is Brahman only, achievable only by bhakti and hence, there cannot be any grades in degree of bliss due to "less bhakti" or "more bhakti" since Brahman is homogenous."   
"there cannot be any grades in degree of bliss" is the sadhya (to be proven).   
What is the hetu here?   
1. the object of all upāyās here is Brahman only.   
2. Brahman is achievable only by bhakti   
3. Brahman is homogenous.   
No matter what their claim is (one of them is hetu, some of them are hetu, all of them are hetu), there is no correlation between hetu and sādhya.   
Their understanding of equality itself is very defective.   
Even in day-to-day life, people have some good understanding of the word "equal or sama". For example, if one says "the teacher treats all his students equally", It means that the teacher treats them as per their performance and does not show any favoritism. No one would expect that the teacher will give equal marks to all the students in his class. Nor does it mean that if he conducts a running race   
or any other contest, he will give same first prize to all the students/contestants irrespective of how bad or good the student's performance is. If the teacher really does so, they will say that the teacher is terrible. That being the case, what a terrible quality they are attributing to the Lord, that too by stating that not only the Lord gives the same bliss to the "kali puruşa", but also the same bliss as what He has. Nothing is a greater disaster than this.   
Then they claim that the mukti is available for all. This means that they are claiming that Lord Krishna is a liar as He clearly says in Bhagavadgita -   
aśraddadhānāḥ puruṣā dharmasyāsya parantapa | aprāpya māṁ nivartante mṛtyusaṁsāravartmani ||

"Oh tormentor of the enemies, those who do not trust this knowledge,   
will not attain me and struggle in the ways of the mrutyu rūpa saMsāra."   
"These cruel haters, worst of men, I always throw them into saMsāra (cycles of birth and death) and into demonical wombs.   
Then O Kunti's son, these fools, having acquired the demonical wombs, recursively every birth, never reach me and attain the abysmal hellish realms."   
From this, it is crystal clear that mukti is not available to all. Further, claiming that those who do very great Bhakti like chaturmukha Brahma and those who do very little bhakti get same bliss in mokṣa and even worse claiming that the haters of the Lord also get that same bliss will attribute "vaiṣamya doṣa" (flaw of partiality in Lord. "sameṣu viṣamabuddhi" or "viṣameṣu samabuddhi" is vaiṣamya doṣa. Treating as per what they deserve is real samabuddhi.   
Then as usual they just throw a statement that need not be objected to -   
—   
Brahman is the source of enjoyment for all - that is fine.   
These general statements have no bearing what so ever on their wild claims.   
Further the gradation of bliss in mokṣa is also clearly stated in Brahma sutra   
—   
"OM vṛddhihrāsabhāktvamantarbhāvādubhayasāmañjasyādevam OM"   
ॐ वृद्धिह्रासभाक्त्वमन्तर्भावादुभयसामंजस्यादेवम् ॐ   


Brahmasūtra - 3-2-20   

ब्रह्मसूत्र - ३-२-२०   

"There is increase and decrease (gradation) in bliss due to difference in jñāna and bhakti, for only then impartiality of the Lord towards both would be seen".   
When a question comes "Why is that so?", that is answered by the next sutra   
—   
"OM darśanācca OM"   
ॐ दर्शनाच्च ॐ   
Brahmasutra -3-2-21   
- ब्रह्मसूत्र - ३-२-२१   
"Because it is seen in the Vedas.".   
So, if the Visiṣṭādvaitins think that the statements of Taittirīya and Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣat vākyas are for baddha jīvas only, they should still concede that there should be some other Vedic statements that   
speak of gradation of bliss.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
In other words, bhakti, whether done in less quantity or more, results in only one end, namely mokṣa. Vedic yajnAs are many, have different results and require bodily means. But BhagavAn is one and the same for all.   
Siddhānta:   
Again a typical conglomeration.   
bhakti, whether done in less quantity or more, results in only one end, namely mokṣa. - The question is not whether all the deserving ones showing right kind of Bhakti reach mokṣa or not. The question is whether there every one including the most tāmasik ones get the same amount of the bliss as the Lord Himself.   
Vedic yajnAs are many, have different results and require bodily means. If a point is made that the subject of Bhakti is God and so the bliss in mokṣa is same, then by the same logic, since the subject of yajñas is God and that too requires bhakti, then the fruits of all vedic yajñas must be the same. Are the Visiṣṭādvaitins aware that the mokṣa sādhana also requires bodily means? Even they wont speak of mokṣa sādhane after reaching mokṣa.   
But BhagavAn is one and the same for all. - Isn't Bhagavān propounded by the Vedic yajñas ? There is double trouble here. It is a big logical loop-hole that 'Bhagavān is one and the same for all' does not imply that the outcome of bliss should be the same for all. Secondly accepting that just for a minute will lead to other difficulties like the Vedic yajñas should also yield the same result. Further such a weird claim attributes vaiṣamya doṣa to the Lord. The worst thing is this. The greatest sinners also get the same bliss as Chaturmukha Brahma. And all of them get the same bliss as Bhagavān. And the reason is given that it is so because the source is the same !!   
Pūrvapaksa:   
(Special Note: It is my observation that MAdhvA"s assumption that Prapatti being easier than Bhakti is wrong as well. PrapannAs also have to follow a code of conduct, far beyond the reach of baddhAtmAs like ourselves. PrapannAs need a thorough knowledge of rahasyas, and have two options, to either spend their life propagating Ubhaya VedAntA, or indulging in Yoga for Bhagavan's sake. Note that Yoga is not done as UpAyA by prapannAs, but as a kainkaryam to Bhagavan. This was explained by Sri Velukkudi Swami in a UpanyAsam.   
Siddhanta:   
Suppose a person gives a statement   
—   
"Having a gun alone is not enough to go to a battle field; one must also have the training how to use the gun, must also strategize how to fight, etc."   
Then it is not wise to say the person is asking not to take the gun to the battle field.   
Also look at the kind of argument that is being made.   
It is my observation that MAdhvA"s assumption that Prapatti being easier than Bhakti is wrong as well. This is an extremely flawed observation.   
There are two parts here.   
1. Prapatti is wrong.   
—   
2. The reason for that is because it is easier than Bhakti.   
First of all, he never said 1.   
Secondly, 2. is even more flimsy and he never said 2.   
It is this writer's assumption that Acharya Madhva assumed that.   
It is strange that people hear a few upanyasams and jump to rash conclusions without proper study of all the relevant texts.   
Isn't Bhakti required for kainkaryam as well? What is their understanding of prapatti without Bhakti ? How can there be a true bhakti without proper jñāna ? If there is true jñāna, which   
encompasses true Bhakti, which inturn encompasses true prapatti, then that is a whole package.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
But this does not indicate partiality on the part of brahman, ie giving equal mokṣa for all.   
Siddhanta:   
It does indicate partiality. Also it goes against many scriptural statements and it is irrational as well.   
It is one thing to say mokṣa for all (which is wrong by itself) and then to make it worse, it is claimed that equal mokṣa is given to all.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
The PancarAtrA quotes PerumAl saying, 'I accept Bhakti and Prapatti.   
For differences in the two paths, please refer articles on the net or consult a vidwAn.)   
Siddhanta:   
Referring articles on the net or consulting a vidwān or referring some works are truly necessary acts, but not sufficient.   
No one denies that Lord accepts Bhakti and Prapatti. No where is it mentioned that all get equal bliss.   
It is natural that other schools get perturbed when they hear that Acahrya Madhva refuted 21 schools, the main ones that came until then. But proof of the pudding is in its eating.   
We hear very conflicting statements like   
-   
1. True jñāna alone is needed for attaining liberation.   
(nānyah panthā ayanāya vidyate | ) ( नान्यः पन्था अयनाय विद्यते । )   
2. Karma alone is needed for attaining liberation.   
(karmaṇyevādhikāraste), (niyatam kuru karma..) (Huùquareà), (fauak कुरु कर्म ...)   
3. There are two paths   
—   
- loke-asmin dvividhā niṣṭhā ...   
(jñānayogena sāMkhyānām karmayogena yoginām) ( ज्ञानयोगेन सांख्यानाम् कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम्)   
3. Bhakti alone is needed for attaining liberation. (nāhamvedairna tapasā...bhaktyā tvananyayā śakya...)   
(नाहम् वेदैर्न तपसा...भक्त्या त्वनन्यया शक्य....)   
4. Prapatti alone is needed for attaining liberation.   
(sarva dharmān parityajya māmekam śaranam vraja ) ( सर्व धर्मान् परित्यज्य मामेकम्   
शरणम् व्रज)   
If one goes thru all the commentaries, it becomes self-evident, how other schools just got lost and gave very inconsistent replies that dont even hold water and how Acharya Madhva gave brilliant   
interpretation.A true Prapatti is not possible without proper Bhakti. A true Bhakti is not possible without proper jñāna. Proper karma is not possible without proper jñāna.   
jñāna mārga and karmamārga that were mentioned is based on prāchurya and so on.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
Parakala Yati states that BrahmAnandam is not exclusively enjoyed by Brahman only.   
Siddhānta:   
—   
"BrahmAnandam is not exclusively enjoyed by Brahman only" This is a meaningless statement because of the inherent ambiguity. What is meant by the expression Brahmanandam ? In case of Brahman, it is Brahmaṇaḥ Anandam. It is His own bliss. In case of others, it can mean the bliss obtained by thinking about Brahman and also that is also controlled by Brahman, given by Brahman, brought to experience by Brahman, etc. The Lord does not give His own bliss to others. The jīva does not have the capacity to experience his own bliss without the grace, control and approval of the Lord.   
People have to have some basic understanding of the qualities like jñāna and ānanda, as to how they function, regarding giving, taking, sharing, etc.   
If one shares material things woth another, then there will be dimunition of that entity - like if 5 people share 5 bananas equally, each gets only one banana. Sharing knowledge and joy is like lighting a lamp. If X gives his knowledge to Y, the knowledge of X does not come down at all. Similarly if X gives happiness to Y, under normal conditions, the joy of X does not have to come down. Here the giving or sharing does not diminish the entity.   
Secondly, it is not even possible or practical for X to give his entire knowledge to Y. Similarly it is not possible for X to give his entire joy to Y.   
Thirdly, the gradations take effect every step of the way. The following explanation of knowledge holds good to bliss as well.   
If we take persons say X1, X2, X3, X4, etc, each will have different levels of knowledge (the subjects or kinds itself varies so much and to make it a little simpler, let us restrict to the spiritual knowledge and spiritual joy alone).   
Even if we take persons of same or similar levels, their desire/willingness to give/share varies. Their capacities to give/share varies again.   
Let us say Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, etc are the receivers of jñāna or ānanda. Again how much they receive and how much they retain varies according to their yogyata.   
Thus the Lord makes the jīva experience the jīva's inherent bliss, when it is right time (that is after mukti). Even materialistic joy is given by Him only. He alone is svatatntra and every one else is dependent on him.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
He provides examples once again such as the wife enjoying her husband's gunAs, the student enjoying his teacher"s and the son enjoying his parent "s.   
Siddhānta:   
Any school of philosophy that wishes to establish advocate a major philosophical principle has to resort to one of the three pramāṇa-s pratyakṣa or anubhava (pratyakṣa has to be parīkṣita or verified) āgama (nirdoṣa śabda is āgama) anumāna (logic utilizing pratyakṣa and/or āgama). The apparent meanings of āgama are as misguiding as the apparent appearances of things. While Advaita has found its strength (or weakness so to speak) in superficial meanings of āgama vākyas, it resorted to second level of defense by desperately searching for examples, by which they were equally misguided if not   
more.   
Firstly examples are never a prof for any philsophical principle. Secondly the more we analyze those examples, the more evident the weakness turns out to be.   
—   
It is very strange that Viśiṣṭādvaita, which quite successfully pointed out many flaws of Advaita, is trying to take much weaker approach than Advaita. Without even the support of atleast a few glaringly apparent āgama vākyas (except for only one apparent statement "paramam sāmyamupaiti"), they are trying to advocate a major concept of equal bliss as the Lord for every jīva including the eternal haters of the Lord. That statement not only has other meaning like 'just similarity', but not equality, the equality interpretation goes against many other pramāṇa-s. The examples that they have chosen are more damaging to their position itself.   
I have elaborately pointed out the flaw in wife and husband example. The same kind of flaw decorates student-teacher example and son- father example. Heavy confusion is introduced by using expressions like one enjoying the other's guṇa-s. In an eagerness to justify the example, one enjoying the other's guṇa-s is interpreted as one approving the other's guṇa-s.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
The muktA realizes that he is the SarIrA (and hence, SeshA) of Brahman, and this alone is enough to give him infinite AnandA.   
Siddhānta:   
There is not a single pramāņa that says that jīva is the śarIra of Brahman. Added to that as poiinted out earlier, that leads to several flaws. Again what has such a realization to do with infinite ānanda? That alone is enough? Where is the pramāṇa? That too that alone is enough? Then the following question arises.   
Does a jñāni in baddha state realize that he is the śarIra of Brahman. In particular, does their own Acharya and other glorious ones in their parampara realize that? If they don't without any āgama pramāņa how are they claiming that? If they do, then in amukta/baddha state itself they must be getting infinite ānanda, as that alone is enough (meaning there is no need for prārabdha to be completed, etc.)   
Pūrvapaksa:   
This does not decrease the status of Brahman in anyway.   
Siddhānta:   
—   
This is what is called straw man argument. The reason for rejecting their position is not that 'it is going to decrease the status of Brahman in anyway'. The reasons for rejecting their position is absence of any valid pramāņa and also that it goes against many other pramāṇa-s. One cannot argue "This does not decrease the status of Brahman in anyway and so let us accept it". Such an approach is invalid. For accepting any position, it must have valid pramāṇa-s and it should not go against other valid pramāņa-s. Their position lacks both. It does not have valid pramāṇa-s and it goes against other valid pramāṇa-s.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
(Special Note: Perumal is described as "Madhu", "Annam", "AramudE", etc. He derives anandA from His own nature, but we can enjoy it as well, just as we enjoy the qualities of Madhu, Annam and "Aramudham". 'Unnum ChOru, Parugum Neer....' is a famous pAsuram). This, in brief, is a refutation of the Ananda TAratamya. Let us note that our pUrvAchAryAs" interpretation of AnandA in mokṣa is based completely on Nammazhwar"s "Uyarvara Uyarnalam" pathigam.   
Siddhānta:   
Very strange argument in deed. Let us list what is being said   
1. Perumal is described as "Madhu".   
2. He derives anandA from His own nature   
3. But, we can enjoy it as well   
4. just as we enjoy the qualities of Madhu   
This, in brief, is a refutation of the Ananda TAratamya.   
Is this for real? How can the above set prove that our joy is the same as Perumal's joy? How can a figurative expression about entity A, used by entity B prove that the bliss of B equals to bliss of A ?   
This is like going to a car dealer to buy the car and he shows a refrigerator that has 4 wheels. He tells "Like a car this has four wheels. Just as you get cool air in the car, you get cool air in this. So this is your car."   
The above example of Perumal, madhu and the jīvas is like   
1. A parent calls his/her child "Honey"   
(madhu).   
2. The child derives ānanda from His own nature   
3. But, the parents can enjoy it as well   
4. Just as parents enjoy the qualities of honey (madhu)   
leading to the conclusion that the joy of the child equals to the joy of the parents always. People can even get very excited and further say "when the child cries, the parents cry, when the child is happy, the parents are happy. So, they are equal in joy.".   
In the latter example, atleast there is some possibility for them to be equal. But in the Permual and jīva example, the joy of the jīva can be nowhere near that of Perumal.   
The humans, animals and birds all have great affinity for food and water. Not only they satisfy the hunger and thirst, they also give susteance and energy. They are essential for the existence.   
The devotees in the form of men extolled Lord's forms and Lord's names as food and water. That has multi-level significance. They express the love of devotees for the Lord. Even deeper than that is the concept that the Lord is present in all the foods and water and gives sustenance to all.   
Note that Sri Purandara Dāsaru says   
-   
"Rāma nāma pāyasakke Kṛṣṇa nāma sakkare Viṭṭhala nāma tuppava berasi bāya capparīsiro..."   
राम नाम पायसक्के कृष्ण नाम सक्करे विट्ठल नाम तुप्पव बेरसि बाय चप्परीसिरो...   
It is a ridiculous claim that this kind of extolling the Lord refutes ānanda tāratamya and that this establishes ānanda-sāmya.   
Thus describing, extolling and comparing the Lord to "Madhu",   
"Annam", "AramudE",   
'Unnum Choru, Parugum Neer....', etc in no way speak of Ananda sāmya.   
What the Viśiṣṭādvaitins did was labelling the pure devotees that were before Sri Rāmānuja as "Alwars" and falsely interpreted their works to suit the Visiṣṭādvaita position. Kulasekhara Maharaja was never called ālwar before the advent of Sri Rāmānuja. Even the above comparison of 'Unnum Choru, Parugum Neer...." to the Lord by Nammalwar does not convey any ananda-sāamya. In addition to the absence of statements that support their position from standard scriptures, their futile efforts to interpret these external works also incorrectly shows the amount of desperation they are in. But the simple question is "Why?"   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
Also, an interesting point to note is that Sri ParakAla Yati has not only refuted the idea of gradations in bliss, but has also refuted jiva bhedA   
Siddhānta:   
What is interesting is to note that just as the effort to refute the idea of gradations in bliss fizzled out, so also the refutation of the jiva bheda will fizzle out. What they mean is actually jīvatraividhya as they also have to believe in jīva bheda otherwise there will not be a debate/argument/discussion between two persons, two groups, etc.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
by explaining that the difference in anandA in samsAris is due to expansions and contractions of dharma bhūta jñānA.   
Siddhānta:   
"   
First of all, there is no such thing as dharma-bhūta-jñānA" of their interpretation. It is not Vritti jñāna as they claim that it will continue into mokṣa. It is not svarūpa jñāna as they themeselves claim so. Like hare's horn, it is non-existent. Talking about its contraction and expansion is same as talking about the color of hare's horn.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
This effectively quells the MAdhvA argument that JivAs are intrinsically different because they have different likes and dislikes.   
Siddhānta:   
No one has to quell these arguments. They have all been self-   
destructive.   
Without a single scriptural support and without a single logical   
reasoning, how could they make such a claim? It is like a bubble that has already burst.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
The Sruti 'Yasya AtmA SarIram' and numerous other Vedic/PurAnic vAkyAs assert that JivA is the body of BhagavAn, and hence, subservient to BhagavAn.   
Siddhānta:   
There is absolutely no regard for context, no regard for consistency. We cannot take superficial meanings for vedic statements. Just as mahavakyas do not speak of identity of Jiva and Brahman, the statements saying somethingas shrIra of God do not literally mean that the God has them as His sharIra. We have to take them "like sharIra only". Just because we are inside a vehicle and control the vehicle, the vehicle does not become our body.   
In Bṛhadāraṇyakopanisat(), Gautama asks yājñavalkya   
antaryāmiṇam brūhi (3iHu4qi) (explain me about the Lord's   
antaryāmitva).   
This is in Antaryāmi brāhmana (अन्तर्यामि ब्राह्मण ) .   
yaḥ pṛthivyām tiṣṭhan pṛthivyā antaro, yam pṛthivī na veda, yasya pṛthivī śarīram, yaḥ pṛthivīmantaro yamayati eșa te ātmā antaryāmyamṛtam |

The Upaniṣat goes on describing the similar thought wrt Water, Fire, Antarikṣa, Vāyu, Dyu, vijñāna etc. Note that we have to take infact the abhimāni devats for these tatvas.   
While in this upaniṣat, it is said

vāti = carries around; Hence Garuda is also known as Pṛthivi.   
पृथु पूर्ण हरि - वाति पृथिवि ।   
Both Vijñāna and ātma are described as Chaturmukha Brahma. (ātmā vijñānamiti tu sarvajīvābhimānavān brahmaivoktastvime...)   
(आत्मा विज्ञानमिति तु सर्वजीवाभिमानवान् ब्रह्मैवोक्तस्त्विमे...)   
The basic concept is that it is about Sarvāntryāmitva.   
What has this to do with refuting jiva traividhya?   
Purvapaksa:   
Therefore, all jivAs are subservient.   
Siddhanta:   
—   
Prthu   
=   
Of course. This is slipping in a valid statement, that gives no support to their position. If the jīvas are subservient to God, they must have the basic awareness that they are inferior to God in every respect, including the jñāna, ānanda and every guņa.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Since a body serves a soul willingly,   
Siddhānta:   
A big fall. The body is jaḍa. How can a jaḍa have willingness?   
Pūrvapaksa:   
all jivAs possess the essential nature to serve Him willingly.   
Siddhānta:   
Then Lord Krishna must have had some kind of delusions or   
hallucinations, when He condemned the tāmasik souls in Bhagavadgita in several instances. Those who do not believe that Krishna had delusions must reject this position of Visiṣṭādvaita.   
Not only Gita, there are other sources that support the position that there are inherently tāmasik souls. Apart from several Gīta sentences supporting jīva traividhya and tāmasik souls, there are also several Bhagavata and other purāņa statements, there are Vedic statements, there are Mahabharata and Ramayana statements that support this position.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
Hence, there can be no 'tAmasic' or 'rAjasic' jivAs when they all have the same intrinsic nature to serve Sriman NArAyaNa willingly.   
Siddhanta:   
See above for the total rejection of this position.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Swami Desikan gives the following pramAnAs to show that JivA is omniscient in mokṣa due to expanded dharma bhūta jñānA: CU 7.26-2: Sarvam ha pasya: pasyathi SarvamApnothi Sarvasa: (Meaning): Muktha Jeevan sees every thing in parama padham and through or h the power of his own sankalpam enjoys every thing at all times and is immersed in ParipoorNa BrhmAnandham   
Siddhānta:   
Here Sarva does not mean "every thing". That is not even the purpose. Here Sarva refers to the Lord. Note that Viṣṇu Sahasra nāma also has   
"sarvaḥ śarvaḥ śivaḥ sthāṇuḥ.."(Hå: 31d: f31a: zeny:......). Secondly, the   
शर्वः शिवः स्थाणुः...)   
—   
context also calls for such an interpretation the jiva seeing the Lord, obtaining/reaching the Lord.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
(Sa vaa yEsha yEthEna dhivyEna chakshushA manasaithAn kaamAn pasyan RAMATHE, ya yEthE Brahma 10kE:CU 8.12.5).   
Siddhānta:   
It is shocking that they think that this statement refers to jīva. How could they ignore the very next statement ?   
tam vā etam devā ātmānamupāsate | (तम् वा एतम् देवा आत्मानमुपासते । ) ( The gods   
worship such Lord as the controller of all indriyas).   
If their interpretation means that it is jīva, that would imply that   
the next statement indicates that all the gods worship the jīva. That is terrible.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
The following Sruti VAkyA shows that JivA enjoys Brahman in mokṣa: "yo vai bhUmA thath sukham yathra nAnyath paSyathi nAnyath SruNOthi nAnyath vijAnAthi sa bhUmA".   
Siddhānta:   
—   
What is the context for this and how does this entire portion of śruti vākya runs and what it means we will see further down. Even before that, with their own interpretation, let us see if they achive what they like.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
"The bhUmA is the greatest.   
Siddhanta:   
Since jīva is not the greatest, naturally they also mean that bhūmā refers to God.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
It pervades everywhere and is sarva-viSishtam. It is bliss-self and thus everything.   
Siddhanta:   
That should also be fine - He is everything means that He controls everything.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
He who enjoys this, never sees other things..."   
Siddhanta:   
Surely, having reached Paramātma, the mukta jīva sees Paramātma everywhere and also is not interested in anything else. One sees only Lord never has to mean that One knows the Lord completely or knows everything completely.   
It is very clear that they lost the whole flow and purpose. They keep ending up self-contradicting as well.   
The entire śruti passage goes like this   
—   
'yo vai bhūmā tatsukham | nālpe sukhamasti | bhūmaiva sukham | bhūmā tveva vijijñāsitavya iti bhūmānaṁ bhagavo vijijñāsa' iti ।।

Only the infinite One will have infinite bliss. The alpajīva cannot have infinite bliss (even if it is mukta). Such infinite One only has to be known (1st Brahmasutra). When Sanatkumara says this, Narada requests "oh venerable one, make me know that Infinite One.".

Then, beyond whom, one sees some one else, one hears some one else, one knows some one else, He is alpa or finite one.   
(Meaning he is dependent one). pūrṇasvarūpa Brahman is nityamukta. Then the alpaguņa jīvas are maraṇaśīlas. (Even the great gods, who become mukta jīvas, they have maraṇaśīlatva before reaching mukti). Then Narada asked "Oh venerable one, such where does that Paramātman take refuge in?" Sanatkumara replied "He takes refuge in His own glorious prosperity, or else it can be said in no oe else's prosperity.".

The mukta does not see the anarthas like death, disease, and despair. He sees the activities of the Lord, he obtains the sarva nāmaka Paramātma. He fulfills all of his own deires. He takes one, three, five, seven, nine, eleven, hundred and eleven, thousand and twenty, etc forms."   
It is quite evident that none of these point out any thing even   
remotely that the jñāna and ānanda of the jīva equals that of Brahman.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
With infinite jñānA, JivA is omniscient and enjoys Brahman. This means, JivA has infinite anandA.   
Siddhanta:   
A blind repetition of the same phrase without any supporting evidence will not make that statement true. Only Brahman is omniscient and the jīva is not. jīva enjoying Brahman is not like a boy enjoying a toy. One must have the realization that the expression "jīva enjoys Brahman" means that the jīva enjoys thru the Brahman, from the grace of the Brahman, by seeing Brahman and experiencing the company of the Brahman and especially in mokṣa to the fulll extent of the jīva's capacity. If the expression "X enjoys Brahman" implies that X is omniscient and has equal ānanda as Brahman, then all the "Nanda vraja people" must also be omnixcient and have ananda equal to that of Brahman. Then to avoid such a mess, a bigger mess is brought in thru "DBJ", which is not there any where in the scriptures and which is like a magic wand in the hands of Visiṣṭādvaita, by waving which all kinds of claims are made going aginst the scriptures.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
It should be noted that jivA, though having infinite dharma bhūta jñānA still is anU with regards to svarUpA. Just as sun is localised, but sun rays can spread everywhere, JivA is anU, but it radiates knowledge.   
Siddhānta:   
This is due to the confusion between jñāna and prakāśa. If they think that prakāśa itself is jñāna, then a tube light or a burning candle will have to be considered as having jñāna. jñāna is not visible to the eye, Prakāśa is. jñāna does not pervade into space, Prakāśa does. So bringing jñāna into picture and talking about size, shows heavy confusion. Also what is this DBJ? Is it same as Vritti jñāna or different? If it is different, then every living being has three kinds of jñāna Svarūpa jñāna, Vritti jñāna and DBJ. And their contention is that this DBJ is carried into mokṣa as well. Where is this located? If it is in Svarūpa, then its contraction and expansion, etc indicate the vikāra for the svarūpa. If it is not in Svarūpa, how can it be carried over into mokṣa?   
Pūrvapaksa:   
—   
This knowledge allows cognition of BhumA (Brahman) and enjoy its   
infinite qualities.   
Siddhanta:   
Then what is the role of Svarupa jñāna? The svarupa jñāna does not allow the cognition of Brahman, but DBJ does ? So the Svarupa jñāna in mokṣa is significantly useless compared to DBJ !!   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Other pramAnAs for dharma bhūta jñānA are the vAkyAs like 'He becomes one-fold, three fold....many fold', in Chandogya Up., which state that the muktA can assume multiple bodies at once. MuktA is anU, so the only way for him to assume so many bodies is by his jñānA. Although the AtmA remains localised, it can control several bodies by its jñānA.   
We have purAnic stories of some rishis controlling 50 bodies at once. This is because due to their tapas, their dharma bhūta jñānA was extended sufficiently for them to execute such an act. In mokṣa, this jñānA is infinite.   
Siddhānta:   
Another quagmire. If the muktas assuming multiple bodies in mokṣa is an evidence for DBJ expanding to infinity in mokṣa, then those "some ṛṣis" (It is actually Soubhari) also must be considered as having this DBJ expanded to infinity in saMsāra itself (no need to wait till mokṣa).   
This DBJ acts like an equalizer   
—   
making each one's DBJ expand in succh a way that they equal the ānada of Brahman.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Additional Notes from Sri Ranga Rāmānuja Muni's BhAshyA on Anandavalli of Taittiriya Upanishad   
The theme of Ananda MimAmsa is to determine whether BrahmAnandA can be measured. The Upanishads assume „one unit“ of AnandA for manushyAs and go on to BrahmAnandA, stating later on Yato Vacho Nivartante......“ The words „Shrotriyasya cAkAmahatasya" follow each verse, which mean „One whose study of Vedas has fructified“ and „One who is free of desire". This, according to Upanishad BhAshyakArAr, pertains to muktAs. These words are present to indicate that a muktA also possesses all these anandAs, no matter how much they are multiplied, since a muktA is the enjoyer of all anandA, without exception.   
So, the Upanishad is translated as follows, ...this is one unit of manushya ananda. Multiply by 100, this is one unit of ananda for   
manushya gandharvas and also for a muktA........." And so on until we reach, „Multiply Praj Apati"s (Brahma) AnandA by 100, we get one unit of BrahmAnandA, and also for a muktA". This statement does not mean Brahman`s anandA is only 100 times greater than Brahma`s. Sri Ranga Rāmānuja Muni explains that this is just an expression. We say „Sun is moving as fast as an arrow. In reality, the sun is moving so fast that the arrow's motion appears slow by comparison. Similarly, Brahman`s anandA is many times greater than Brahma“s, and 100 times is just a figure of expression.   
Siddhanta:   
This is a complete loss of ground! Only one thing is meaningful here that 100 is just symbolic only and it signifies just several fold.   
The śruti vākyas were given and explained earlier in this write up.   
Let me reproduce a small part here   
—   
=   
one bliss unit of   
One hundred bliss units of Mukta chakravartis Mukta Manuşya Gandharvas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravana phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become āptakāmas).   
One hundred bliss units of Mukta Manuşya Gandharvas = one bliss unit of Mukta Deva Gandharvas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravana phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become āptakāmas).   
One hundred bliss units of Mukta Deva Gandharvas = one bliss unit of Mukta pitṛ devatas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravana phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become āptakāmas).   
One hundred bliss units of Mukta pitṛ devatas = one bliss unit of Mukta ajānaja devatas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravana phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become āptakāmas).   
One hundred bliss units of Mukta ajānaja devatas one bliss unit of Mukta karmaja devatas, who are śrotriyas (obtained the full śravana phala and also devoid of kāmajanita upadravas, meaning they have become āptakāmas).   
and then it continues from Mukta Karmaja devatas to Mukta devatas, etc. upto Chaturmukha Brahma.   
Note that in each case, the two words "śrotriyasya" and "akāmahatasya" are repeated tirelessly to avoid any confusion and to emphasize that this is "ānanda mīmāṀsa of mukta jīvas only, not   
amukta jivas.   
If Sri Ranga Rāmānuja thinks that "this is one unit of ananda for manushya gandharvas and also for a muktA....... “   
and they want to mix amukta and mukta, then I can only think of two possibilities -   
Possibility-1 :   
100 bliss units of of Amukta chakravartis = 1 bliss unit of Amukta Manuṣya Gandharva 1 bliss unit of Mukta Manuşya Gandharva   
=   
100 bliss units of of Amukta Manuşya Gandharvas = 1 bliss unit of Amukta Deva Gandharva 1 bliss unit of Mukta Deva Gandharva   
100 bliss units of of Amukta Deva Gandharvas = 1 bliss unit of Amukta   
pitṛ devata = 1 bliss unit of Mukta pitṛ devata   
100 bliss units of of Amukta pitṛ devata = 1 bliss unit of Amukta ajānaja devata = 1 bliss unit of Mukta ajānaja devata   
100 bliss units of Amukta ajānaja devatas = 1 bliss unit of Amukta karmaja devata 1 bliss unit of Mukta karmaja devata   
=   
etc. upto Chaturmukha Brahma.   
This implies that the bliss of Amukta is same as bliss of Mukta in each category.   
That is terrible. And aslo this still carries a variation among Mukta jīvas. This goes against their own position.   
Possibility-2 :   
100 bliss units of of Amukta chakravartis = 1 bliss unit of Amukta Manuşya Gandharva 1 bliss unit of an arbitrary Mukta M1   
=   
100 bliss units of of Amukta Manuṣya Gandharvas Amukta Deva Gandharva   
=   
1 bliss unit of   
1 bliss unit of an arbitrary Mukta M1 (the   
same M1)   
100 bliss units of of Amukta Deva Gandharvas = 1 bliss unit of Amukta pitṛ devata 1 bliss unit of an arbitrary Mukta M1 (the same M1)   
=   
1 bliss unit of Amukta   
100 bliss units of of Amukta pitṛ devata ajānaja devata = 1 bliss unit of an arbitrary Mukta M1 (the same M1)   
100 bliss units of Amukta ajānaja devatas = 1 bliss unit of Amukta karmaja devata = 1 bliss unit of an arbitrary Mukta Ml (the same M1)   
etc. upto Chaturmukha Brahma.   
This is probably even worse. The bliss of M1 is very indetrminate and   
arbitraily equated with many. Yet due to equating with amuktas, it is not infinite either. This goes against their own position.   
May be there is another possibility that they can interpret this as.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
MadhvAs unfortunately, have not comprehended the intent of Ananda MimAmsA.   
Siddhānta:   
Unfortunately only a poor understanding and a weak position could lead one to a conclusion that the Madhvas have not comprehended !!   
Especially since the the intent and the words of the Shruti are both very clear and loud. One has to just pay attention to understand this basic concept.   
Also note the following statements from Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣat   
eṣā'sya paramā gatiḥ | eṣā'sya paramā saṁpat | eşo'sya paramo lokaḥ | eṣo'sya parama ānandaḥ | etasyaivā''nandasyānyāni bhūtāni mātrāmupajīvanti ||

"Lord Viṣņu pervades the entire universe. His sampat is infinitely complete. His jñāna is all complete. His bliss is infinitely complete. Other muktas experience an infinitesimal amount of His bliss."   

Pūrvapaksa:   
The whole purpose is to celebrate BrahmAnandA and its incalculable nature,   
Siddhānta:   
Their interpretation is no celebration, but just the opposite. How can equating the bliss of an ordinary jīva with that of Supreme Lord be called a celebration. It is totally rejecting the supremacy of the Lord.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
but instead, they think its purpose is to enumerate the AnandAs of baddha and mukta jivAs, based on their status of Indra, Brahma, Manushya, etc. which are permanent.   
Siddhānta:   
One has to call a spade a spade. Calling by any other name will not make a spade a non-spade.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Note that manushya AnandA is not followed by 'Shrotriya'.   
Siddhānta:   
Of course not. One must have a basic understanding of the whole thing.   
When an invisible aspect of ananda MīmāMsa of Muktas (liberated) is enlisted, it must have a starting point that we can comprehend.   
"tasyeyam pṛthivi sarvā vittasya pūrṇā syāt sa eko mănușa ānandaḥ   
│ . . . "   
. '   
तस्येयम् पृथिवी सर्वा वित्तस्य पूर्णा स्यात् । स एको मानुष आनन्दः। ...   
When we want to start the basic unit of Mukta chakravarti, how do we go about? How much is 1 unit of bliss of Mukta chakravarti? Before going to mokṣa (i.e. in saṀsāra), in Tretayuga, when the Earth is full of prosperity, and the chakravarti rules this entire Earth, what ever bliss he gets multiply that by 100 and that will be 1 unit of his bliss, when he goes to mokṣa. So,   
100 bliss units of Amukta (unliberated) mānuṣa chakravarti (when he rules the entire Earth filled with propserity) 1 bliss unit when He ges to mokṣa.   
Just observe how ananda mīmāMsā starts

"The nature and details of the bliss in mokṣa, that the jñānis surely acquire, will be described herewith. One who stays with Viṣṇu, one who has good qualities, one who has acquired the status of pūrņa adhyayana phala, would acquire his full of bliss, that will be eternal, he will be nirvikāra and full of strength. During saMsāra, when he rules the entire Earth, full of prosperity in Tretayuga what ever bliss he gets - multiply that 100 times and that will be 1 unit of his bliss in mokṣa. Multiply that by 100 and that will be one bliss unit of Manuşya Gandharva and so on."   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
The same vAkyAs appear in the Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣat as well.   
Siddhānta:   
Of course it does. But that still did not help them. As   
strange as   
it may sound, they still did not get it, despite the clear cut message in the śruti.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
The major tenets of the MAdhvA VedAntA have been refuted in the Vijayindra ParAjayA.   
Siddhanta:   
Firstly, the objections to Visiṣṭādvaita are not major tenets of Mādhva Vedanta. Secondly, Visiṣṭādvaita is trying to defend its position by answering the objections of 'Madhva Vedanta'. Thirdly, in that process, they are exhibiting their weak process much more emphatically. The ridiculousness of their position will be proven even more in what follows.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
Khyati Vada   
The MAdhvAs, particularly Jaya TirthA, argue that Sri Rāmānuja"s theory of errors is not right. Sat KhyAti, proposed by Sri Rāmānuja, states that whatever is seen is real and not an illusion. For instance, if one sees a shell and thinks it is silver, it does not mean that what he saw was an illusion. Based on the theory of quintuplication during creation, mentioned in the Upanishads, it can be said that shell possesses a few properties of silver, and hence, what was perceived is actually a bit of silver (namely, the luster of silver) in the shell.   
Siddhānta:   
Using Panchikaraṇa, Sri Shankara had set out to say that the "real world is an illusion". Now Using Panchikaraṇa, Sri Rāmānuja had set out to say that "the illusory silver is real" ? And then to substantiate such a ridiculous position, various types of statements are made which are ambiguous, uncertain and ambivalent. Statements like "It is not an illusion", "A tiny amount of silver is there in shell", "a few properties of silver are there", etc.   
Just because my shirt is green and the leaf is green, one cannot say that a tiny amount of leaf is in my shirt or a tiny bit of my shirt is in the leaf.   
Let us get to the root of their confusion and resolve it once for all.   
A physical substance has two kinds of properties   
1. Physical properties   
state (like solid, liquid, gaseous)   
density: m/v   
color: The pigment or shade   
conductivity: electricity to flow through the substance   
malleability: if a substance can be flattened   
luster: how shiny the substance looks   
Extensive: A physical property that will change if the amount of matter changes.   
mass: how much matter in the sample   
volume: How much space the sample takes up   
length: How long the sample is   
odor: the smell it gives   
2. Chemical properties   
Atomic structure, bonding, eletrons, etc that give potential for the chemical change. It is rather difficult to define chemical property without talking about change. The properties that are exhibited by reacting to other things like potential to ignite and explode or reacting to acids, etc.   
Now if a tiny bit of silver is there, then thru checmical process, one should be able to extract that silver from the shell.   
There is a beautiful saying in the west "All that glitters is not gold". When the whole world knows what the truth is, it does nt make sense for some to go against that truth.   
The illusions can happen for several reasons, In most cases, it is the appearance. The identity of a substance is determined by chemical properties, but not the physical properties. The shell does not have the chemical properties of the silver. So, there is no silver at all in the shell. The cause for the illusion is similarity in appearnce. There can be examples, where a sibstance is mistaken due to similarity in the odor.   
Suppose the water is frozen into ice. The water is liquid and the ice is solid. The physical property is different, yet because the chemical properties (Hydrogen and oxygen in certain ration) are the same the ice is non-different from the water.   
If one does not have a clear concept of pratyakṣa, giving wrong theories will lead to confusion and misguide the people.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
The error is the lack of perception of the shell properties, and perceiving only a minimal property of silver in the shell.   
Siddhānta:   
That is totally wrong. Both the shell and the silver are having the same physical properties (only some, like both are solid, both have the silver color and both have silver luster/shine.) So we are   
PERCEIVING THE SHELL PROPERTIES THAT ARE EXACTLY SAME AS THE SILVER PROPERTIES AND SO SOME GET THE ILLUSION THAT IT IS SILVER. There is no such thing as minimal property, maximum property, etc. The commonness of some physical properties is the root cause for the illusion.   
There is difference in other physical properties like silver is ductile and malleable, where as shell is brittle. Their densities are different. Various kinds of ornaments can be made from silver. No such ornaments can be made from the shell. Their chemical properties are different. The difference in the chemical properties is what confirms that it in deed is an illusion. There are no two things about it.   
If we take the mirage, the ludicrousness hits one's face, if any one makes a claim that there is a tiny amount of water in the mirage. There is some common property between mirage and water in terms of appearance.   
So, let us leave the illusion as illusion and real as real, rather than making one's own unsustenable judgement.Pūrvapaksa:   
Another example is that a person sees a boulder in the night and thinks it is a person. This error is not due to quintuplication, for we cannot say that a bit of the person was in the boulder. However, this is due to cognition of attributes in boulder that can be seen in the person, and neglecting to see the entire boulder. For instance, we see yAnamalai and say it looks like an elephant. So, there is a common property between yAnamalai and elephant, ie, the shape. Hence, something real is perceived here and nothing unreal. The error in perception is the lack of cognition of features such as the fact that the boulder is inert and not sentient, made of stone, etc.   
Siddhanta:   
Firstly any theory can not be proven with examples. Secondly, when the theory is dead wrong, the examples themselves reveal the invalidity of the theory. Thirdly, it is shocking that the believers of those wrong theories present those same ridiculous examples like a parrot, without realizing that the examples do in fact debunk their theories.   
First of all quintuplication or panchikarana has nothing to do with sat khyāti at all. I dont know why a desperate attempt is made to make some connection. Also, they get dragged towards the truth "we cannot say that a bit of the person was in the boulder". Then as if there is a reluctance to see the truth, a weird statement is given "However, this is due to cognition of attributes in boulder that can be seen in the person, and neglecting to see the entire boulder."   
The cause of the illusion is the similarity of appearance. The viewer has seen lot of persons, but very rarely a person shaped boulder. Same is the case with the other example like elephant shaped boulder. In most of these examples, the root cause is the similarity in the appearnce. The supporting causes are like insufficient light, or bright light (like for shell-silver), frequency of viewing or fear or apprehenson (like rope and snake), etc. All these examples are perfect cases of illusion. Surely the shell is real, the rope is real, the stone/boulder is real. Even in case of mirage, the sand, or the road or the fields are real, the sun is real. The illusion happens only when there is similarity and when there is knowledge of things, which we mistake for (Absence of knowledge of snake, silver, person, water) will not lead to the kind of illusions mentioned. Of course absence of knowledge of the latter two is unthinkable.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
Sri Rāmānuja gives the example that Putika can be used as a substitute in sacrifices if Soma is not available. This is because Putika possesses a few traits of Soma.   
Siddhānta:   
A substitute is not an illusion and not even a topic for Sat khyāti vāda. What a confusion !? It is talking about the substitute in case of unavailability of Soma. There are also instances where the substitutes may not even possess a close resemblance.   
Pūrvapakṣa:   
Jaya Tirtha argues stating that there is no proof that a remote causal phenomenon would cause one substance to possess quantities of the other. Shell does not contain Silver. If so, how did the person perceive the small amount of silver in shell and leave out the major portion, namely, the shell part?   
Siddhānta:   
A good question and no answer. Or rather an attempt is made, but in futile, as shown below.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
Similarly, if Putika contained some proportion of Soma, why recommend Putika as a substitute, when you can use it anyway?   
Siddhānta:   
Another good question and no answer. Or rather an attempt is made, but in futile, as shown below.   
Pūrvapaksa:   
The above refutation is baseless, if you can see it clearly. Jaya Tirtha does not understand that Sri Rāmānuja“s position is different from what he is saying. We do not say silver, in its entirety, is present in shell. But a few attributes of silver, namely, its luster, is present in shell, and as such, we say a bit of silver, namely, its luster is present in shell.   
Siddhānta:   
The real issue is that they dont understand the basics of properties of the substances. The sugar block is white, the lime stone is white and so, will they say that a bit of limestone is in sugar block or vice versa? Cant they understand that the similarity in appearance is caused by both having same kind of luster. See above for more details. When the luster is same, it is puerile to say that "a bit of silver is present". Only small children, who do not have sufficient vocabulary will use one set of words for another set. Only a highlevelof pūrvāgraha makes them justify their mistake by using evenmore ridiculous arguments ike 1% silver and 99% shell is present in the shell, but the viewer does not see and the viewer sees   
15. Pūrvapakṣa (The position of VA):   
They do not accept viśeṣa.   
Siddhānta (The true message from the scriptures):   
This has been discussed extensively inside this article.   
In case of cetana, everything that is inherent of cetana is non- different from cetana as that cetana is "acchedya (Note the Gita verse)" and the qualities are all "yāvaddravyabhāvi" (lasts as long as the object lasts) only, otherwise, one will be forced to attribute vikāra for cetana. It is quite well-known that during saMsāra avastha, the abhivyakti will not be there. So, for cetanas, the qualities will be non-different from the cetana.   
That is why for Brahman, one may say "Brahman is jñāna and Ananda" or "Brahman has jñāna and Ananda". Both are correct.   
In case of jaḍa, the attributes are of two kinds   
"yāvaddravyabhāvi" (lasts as long as the object lasts) and "ayāvaddravyabhāvi" (does not last as long as the object lats). In case of "yāvaddravyabhāvi", there is non-difference. In case of "ayāvaddravyabhāvi", there is both difference and non-difference - difference in one aspect and non-difference in another. In case of such attributes, those attributes may have been lost either naturally or through manual intervention.   
16. Pūrvapakṣa (The position of VA):   
They do not accept Vāyu jIvottamatva.   
Siddhānta (The true message from the scriptures):   
The Upanishads are unanimous in describing Vayu jIvottamatva extensively. He is called "Akhaṇāśma" (like an unbreakable rock). Just for s sample the following is given from Chāndogya Upanishad.

(When devas and asuras, children of Kashyapa Prajapati, set out for war, devas thought that from God's grace, they can conquer asuras and began worshipping Udgitha named Lord to fulfill their wish. First they worshipped Udgitha in Nāsikya vāyu. Knowing this, the asuras infested Nāsikya prāṇa with sins. Hence the Jivas smell both fragrance and foul smell. Then they meditated upon Udgitha in vāk (Agni is abhimāni for vāk). The asuras infested vāk (speech) with evil/sin. Hence one speaks both truth and falsehood. Then same happened with eyes (Sun god). They infested eyes too. Hence one sees seeable (proper) and unseeable (improper). Then same thing happened with ears (Abhimāni Chandra). Hence we hear both good and evil. Same thing happened with mind (Rudra abhimāni), Ahankāra (seṣa abhimāni) and Chitta (Garuḍa abhimāni). Hence we think of good and evil. Then the devas meditated Udgitha in Mukhyaprāṣa. When the asuras tried to attack, afflict and infest Mukhyaprāṇa, they themselves got afflicted and infested like the mud balls hitting the strong stone get powdered. If any one does this kind of Upāsana of "Akhaṇāśma", the evil forces trying to attack such a person will also get destroyed. The worshipper of Mukhyaprāṇa and the Almighty God in Him, will have the good like fragrance only, but not evils like foul smell. Mukhyaprāṇa protects other gods also thru what ever the person eats and drinks. The devotee realizes that Vishnu is all Supreme and gets liberated.)   
The extolling of Mukhyaprāṇa continues.   
Again much further down it is said   
—   
yo ha vai jyeṣṭhaṁ ca śreṣṭhaṁ ca veda jyeṣṭhaśca ha vai   
-   
śreṣṭhaśca bhavati prāṇo vāva jyeṣṭhaśca śreṣṭhaśca || Chāndogya 5-1-1

छान्दोग्य - ५-१-१   
(one who realizes that Mukhyaprāṇa is jyeṣṭha ans śreṣṭha among all the gods, will get liberated and gets jyeṣṭhatva and shreṣṭhatva among his peers.)   
Similar glorification can be seen in other upaniṣads as well. Even the small Upanishat like Iśāvasyopaniṣat extolls Mukhyaprāṇa in the names like   
"Mātariśvā"   
"Vāyu", "Anila", "Amṛta".   
17. Pūrvapakṣa (The position of VA):   
They do not accept Vedavyāsa as incarnation of God.   
Siddhānta (The true message from the scriptures):   
Vedavyāsa is indeed the full incarnation of Viṣṇu. Lord Krishna mentioned that in Gita - vedāntakṛdvedavideva cāham   
—   
Here vedānta is Brahmasutras. Lord is composer of Vedanta (Brahmasutras) and known thru vedas only. Lord Vedavyāsa composed Brahmasutras. He is mentioned as Avatāra of Viṣṇu in Bhāgavata also.   
18. Pūrvapakṣa (The position of VA):   
They don't accept Pancha bheda (or five-fold difference)   
Siddhānta (The true message from the scriptures):   
This is both pratyakṣasiddha and Agamasiddha. No difference can be denied here. This has been discussed in detail inside this article.
