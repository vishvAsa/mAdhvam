Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana Vyāsa is not an āveśa avatāra; rather, he is a svāṁśa avatāra. You may ask What is the pramāṇa to consider Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana as not a jīva, but Viṣṇu-tattva?

This question does not arise, because only his birth is glorified as svāṁśa avatāra, and there is no statement specifying him as a jīva. कृष्णद्वैपायनं व्यासं विद्धि नारायणं प्रभुम् । Instead, Scriptures do not mention others like Bṛhaspati or aswathama as swayam Narayana. Only Satyavatī-Pārāśara-suta and Hari is glorified as Svayam Nārāyaṇa. Also, there are statements in the śāstras which describe how Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana deluded the demons and made them think of him as a jīva with doshas. You do not find this for others. Neither Bṛhaspati nor Aśvatthāmā will be reborn as Vyāsa. They are Chirañjīvi.  Instead, they are empowered by Vyāsa-rūpa Bhagavān to act on his behalf.  Also, the śāstras do not mention Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana, Hari as a common jīva without āveśa before becoming Vyasa, unlike Aśvatthāmā and Bṛhaspati. In contrast, others have different stories explaining how they were elevated to Vyāsa-pada.

Śrī Madhvācārya’s doctrine of Vyāsa-traya refers to three distinct manifestations associated with “Vyāsa”, each with a different ontological status (tattva-bheda). This is a standard and important point in Tattvavāda (Dvaita Vedānta).

## 1. Vyāsa as svāṁśa.
कृष्णद्वैपायनं व्यासं विद्धि नारायणं प्रभुम् ।... व्यासो नारायणस्यांशो....
Satyavatī-Pārāśara-suta, Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana, is exclusively declared as Svayam Nārāyaṇa, no others are said so. This is not a temporary manifestation, or elevation to Vyāsa-pada, but an eternal one filled with bliss always.

Below are not an avēśa but Svāṁśa Vyāsa

|Uttama Manvantara | Hari | Svayam Nārāyaṇa |
|Cākṣuṣa Manvantara | Hari | Svayam Nārāyaṇa |
|Vaivasvata Manvantara | Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana | Svāṁśa of Nārāyaṇa |
|Brahma-sāvarṇi Manvantara | Hari | Svayam Nārāyaṇa |

## 2. Vyāsa as āveśa in mahā-ṛṣis
They do not take birth as Vyāsa, but are elevated to Vyāsa-pada temporarily with the help of āveśa. They have different stories describing how and when they were elevated ( Vyāsatva ).

## 3. Non maharShis
Vyāsatva is not limited only to mahā-ṛṣis
Vyāsatva is also extended to ordinary jīvas who propagate vaidika dharma, as stated in the following verse from the Viṣṇu Purāṇa:

पुराणवेदवेदान्तमहाभारतकृद्विभुः ।
चतुर्वेदा यतः प्रोक्तास्तस्माद्व्यास इति स्मृतः ॥ ९ ॥

## Vyāsa-pīṭha
The Vaidika sampradāyas, has the concept of Vyāsāsana or Vyāsa-pīṭha. The ācāryas who sit on that Vyāsa-āsana are to be respected as representatives of Vyāsa, and antargata Vyāsa upāsanā is to be performed through them. If they step down from that seat for any reason, such upāsanā in them is not recommended. However, there is no such situation in the case of Hari and Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana Vyāsa. Jīvas who become Vyāsa, on the other hand, are subject to such situations.

Always, only Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana Vyāsa, Hari are to be worshipped through the mahā-ṛṣis and ācāryas in the Vyāsa-pīṭha.

स्वायम्भुवेऽन्तरे त्वाद्यः प्रजापतिरुदाहृतः ।  
प्राचेतसस्तथा व्यासः स्वायम्भुवमनन्तरम् ॥  
उत्तमे तु हरिः साक्षात् ततो व्यासः प्रजापतिः ।  
रैवते तु तथैवोक्तः सोमशर्मा महामुनिः ॥  
चाक्षुषे तु हरिः साक्षात् व्यासो ह्यभवदव्ययः ।  
वैवस्वतेऽन्तरे त्वेष कृष्णद्वैपायनः स्मृतः ॥  
एते व्यासा हि विख्याता अष्टाविंशतिरुच्यते ।  
मन्वन्तरेषु सर्वेषु वेदव्यासनियोजिताः ॥  
स्वायम्भुवेऽन्तरे त्वाद्यः प्रजापतिरुदाहृतः ।  
प्राचेतसस्तथा व्यासः स्वायम्भुवमनन्तरम् ॥
