This is not pramana

There was debate between lingarajendra swami and vijayeendra teertharu on the paratattvam of Mahadeva

Lingarajendra, told that Shiva is sarvottama quoting “EkO rudrO na dvitIyOvatasthE shiva Eva kEvalaM”.  He also quoted a story from one of the tamasa purana, wherein Shiva got bruhat lingaakara, and Brahma in hamsa roopa – Vishnu in Varaha roopa both failed to find the top and bottom of the linga and surrendered before Shiva Then Vijayeendra Tirtharu quoted the story is from taamasa purana and is not to be taken as pramana, as Sri Vedavyasa has quoted that quotes from tamasa purana are only for asura jana mohanaartha. He also showed the quote from Vedavyasa which says 

> “vaishnavam naaradIyam cha tathaa bghaagavatham shubham | gaaruDam cha tathaa paadmaM vaaraahaM shubhadarshanE | ShaDEtaani puraaNaani saatvikaani mataani vai | brahmaaMdaM brahmavaivartham maarkaMdEyaM tathaiva cha | AgnEyaM cha ShaDEtaani taamasaa nirayapradaa: | 

meaning  - Satvika puraanaas are six – VaishNava, naaradIya, bhaagavatha, garuDa, padma, and Varaaha.  Raajasa puraanaas are six – BrahmaanDa, brahmavaivarta, maarkaMDeya, bhaviShyOttara, vaamana and braahma.   Taamasa puraanas – matsya, korma, linga, Skanda, shaiva, Agneya.

Then Lingarajendra quoted pUrva khanda of varaha Purana as varaha Purana is sattvika and siva paratattvam is established but vijayeendra teertharu said that even sattvika Purana have tAmasika rajasika portions,even tAmasika and rajasika have the same sattvika portions,hence purva khanda of varaha Purana is not pramana as it's tAmasika portion of sattvika puranam.
