Shriman Madhwacharya has composed many great works like sutra bhashyas, even then out of kindness towards his devotees, he composed Krishnamrutha Maharnava too, so that they can do paraayana [ reading ] easily and get punya. On the same lines the great Shri Narayana pandithachaaryaru also composed Madhwamrutha Maharnava for those devotees who are unable to read and understand the great work Shri Sumadhvijaya. This has been composed in simple samskritha and it increases the Guru Bhakthi towards Shri  Madhwacharyaru for those who read it. During Dwapara yuga Bheemasena devaru destroyed evil like Duryodhana using his mighty Gadha, on the same lines Bheemasena devaru has taken the avataara of Shri Madhwacharyaru in this Kaliyuga and by using the Mace [Gadhayuda] of TatwaGnaana he destroys the Kali [Demon] that is living in our hearts.

Those people whose heart does not have the tatwagnaana of Shri Madhwacharyaru, there kali will be very strong and kali will
force the individual into doing wrong/prohibited activities and thus gain paapa.

In this world everyone is hankering for success and fruitification of their wishes, but they dont know the way to achieve it.
If one reads the works of Shri Madhwacharyaru and conducts his life as per that then all those wishes will be fruitified, but
people dont have this knowledge and hence always keeps suffering. If only one knows the meaning of Shrimadaananda Teertha, then all his wishes will get fulfilled, that being the case if one puts effort to read and understand the works of Shri
Madhwachaaryaru then he will get moksha also.

Below is given the verse by verse translation of this great work by Narayana Pandithacharyaru.
