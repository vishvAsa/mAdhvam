Madhwamrutha Maharnava.








[22] If one crictisises the MadhwaShaastra and instead goes and studies Adhvaitha, then that person is willingly entering the
deepest and goriest of all hells, ie the andhatamas.

[23] As per maayavaada there is no difference between food and excreta. Thus if a maayavadi has food, he should understand
that he is eating excreta like a dog does.

[24] As per maayavaada there is no difference between horse and dog, for travelling if he uses a horse, its like travelling
on a dog since in maayavaada there is no difference between them.

[25] As per maayavaada there is no difference between yagnopavitha and animal skin, so that person for maintaining brahmanatwa
can as well wear the animal skin since in maayavaada there is no difference between them.

[26] One who worships other devatas than Shri Hari as the most exalted God, that person is as foolish as a thirsty person
digging a well on the banks of River Ganga for drinking water.

[27] One who worships others as Guru instead of Vaayu Deva, that person is like a person who bows down to a chandala
lady who boils and eats dogs instead of bowing down to his mother.

[28] One who worships Vishwaksena [who is son of Vaayu deva] instead of Vaayu deva [as Vishishtadvaitis do], that person
person is known as chandala in that life itself and he will go to andha tamas after death.

[29 â€“ 33] One who studies only vedas and ignores MadhwaShaastra, that person is known as chandala in that life itself and
he will go to naraka after death.

[34] A Brahman who does not put the mark of chakra, shanka and ignore MadhwaShastra is a worst class brahman and he will
loose all dharma and will go to naraka.

[35] Shri Hari likes MadhwaShaastra extremely and marks of Chakra and Shanka. That person who does not have them will
loose all dharma and will go to naraka.

[36] If a pious brahmin does good karmas but ignores learning/hearing MadhwaShastra, then all the pious work done by
him like yagnas, builinding temples are all waste and will not fetch him punya.

[37] If a pious brahmin does yagnopavitha dhaarana, shikaa dharana, urdhwapundra dharana but ignores learning/hearing MadhwaShastra, then all the pious work done by
him like yagnas, builinding temples are all waste and will not fetch him punya.

[38] One who does not wear Urdhwapundra and ignores MadhwaShaastra, that person is known as chandala in that life itself and
will loose all dharma.

[39] One who does not wear Yagnopavitha and ignores MadhwaShaastra, that person is known as chandala in that life itself.

[40] In this Ghastly Kaliyuga where dharma is almost dead nobody bothers to remember All knowing Shri Madhwacharyaru who is the most
favorite to Shri Veda Vyaasaru.

[41] There is no bad luck for devotees of Shri Madhwacharya and for the haters only misery will be there.

[42] First one should worship Shri Madhwacharyaru and then worship Shri Hari, otherwise one will not get moksha and will
get only naraka.

[43] In this birth and in future births too, only those understand Madhwa Shaastra will go to moksha, if not only andhatamas
beckons.

[44] One who does not do the dhyaana of Shri Madhwacharyaru with one pointed focus, what use is the dana done by that person,
what use is the pilgrimage done by that person, what use is the homas done by that person, what use is the tapas done
by that person. nothing.

[45] On whose tongue the word Madhwa constantly resides , that person need not do teerthayaatra of Kurukshetra, that person
need not take bath in holy pinaki rivers.

[46] If a person has devotion towards Shri Madhwacharyaru, then even if he lives for 5 days its great, if there is no devotion
then even living for 1000 kalpas is wasted.

[47] A person Living everyday without having devotion towards the all knowing Shri Madhwacharyaru, that person is only a load
on this earth, the food is wasted on him.

[48] Shri Madhwacharyaru is greater than Saraswathi Devi, He is the most best of all the devotees of Shri Hari, All the jeevas
are under his control, thus one should contemplate on the completeness, greatness of Shri Madhwacharyaru. Bhakthi means one
should think of Shri Madhwacharyaru as more friendly than anything else on earth. This is the best repentance too.

[49] One who drinks and eats without offering to Shri Madhwacharyaru and Shri Hari first, that food consumed by that person
is equal to excreta of a dog and water is equal to alcohal.

[50] One who thinks about Shri Madhwashaastra while eating every morsel, that person is eligible of moksha otherwise he is
eating only for filling stomach.
[51] One who does not take teertha of Shri Madhwacharyaru and instead eats, than that food he eats is akin to dogs excreta
and he will go to naraka.

[52] If a brahmana is a devotee of Shri Madhwacharya then the dootas of yama will not even think about him in their dreams also,
He will be free of all fears.

[53] The 3.5 crore teertha abhimaani devatas present in the 3 worlds will be in the feets of the devotee of Shri Madhwacharyaru.

[54] Those who wear the marks of Shri Madhwacharyaru, a mere look of them will get rid of great sins.

[56] The water that washes the feet of the brahmana devotee of Shri Madhwacharyaru will become as pious as the waters of
River Ganga that has the ability to purify everything.

[57] Rakshasha, pishachis, gandharvas, daityas, daanavas all these run away seeing the devotee of Shri Madhwacharyaru from afar
itself

[58] Even in the ashuchi mletcha lands if there is Shri Madhwashaastra anywhere, then 3 yojanas around that will become
Shri MadhwaKshetra itself.

[59] The person who does seva of maayavada insted of madhwashaastra, that person
must be tied to a huge boulder and thrown into deep ocean.

[60] The shaastra that has been prepared by Shri Vedavyasa is True Shastra, The shaastra that has been prepared by
Shri Madhwacharyaru is True Shastra, Rest all are false. This is the opinion of knowledeble gyaanis.

[61] One who takes shelter of evil shastras insted of MadhwaShaastra, then he is akin to doing seva of neem tree instead
of Kalpavruksha

[62] One who gives the pravachana of Madhwashaastra, whatever he does becomes right. He will even get moksha for yogis also.

[63] If someone tells that other shastras would give moksha, it is as impossible as a deepa buring without oil. By studying
other shastras, it will be akin to eating poison along with food.

[64] The moksha that is got by studying Madhwashastra is like eating milk and food which gives sukha only. Thus one must
strive extra hard to get good mind and study Madhwashaastra.

[65] Shri Hari is the supreme most superior to all. Shri Madhwacharyaru gives power to AdiShesha and others and is
superiour to all other jeevas.

[66] Rudra, Shesha and other pious jeevas everyday listen to Madhwashaastra with devotion, thus they get moksha.

[67] Shesha, Rudra will always be under the control of Shri Madhwacharyaru by the command of Shri Hari. They will never
go against the word of Shri Madhwacharyaru.

[68] By the command of Shri Hari, the vedas are still singing about Shri Madhwacharyaru. For one who has taken shelter of
Shri Madhwacharyaru what is impossible.

[69] By the command of Shri Hari, the husband of Bharathi Devi, Shri Madhwacharyaru takes care of the creation, maintanance
and destruction of this universe and is constantly ending the lives of evil people.

[70] Even if somebody takes the name of Shri Madhwacharyaru under any context, ie on making fun of others too like saying,
hey you have put a naama like Shri Madhwacharyaru, hey you are behaving in anger like the great Shri Madhwacharyaru, even taking
Shri Madhwacharyas name in those context also it will destroy all the sins of that person.

[71] Those who think about Shri Hari without thinking about Shri Madhwacharyaru, their thinking will be as futile as thinking
about mating a highly respectable women high in the heirarchy.

[72] Those who sing about Shri Hari without singing about Shri Madhwacharyaru, for them its just a throat pain and it will
not fetch them moksha

[73] Thus that brahmana who takes the name of Shri Hari along with Shri Madhwacharyaru, for him moksha is assured.

[74] Those who crictisise the maayavaadis who cricticise the kalpavruksha called Shri Madhwacharyaru, they are also
assured of moksha.

[75] Those who crictisise Madhwashaastra either by action, mind,speech they go to andhatamas. Those who scold such
people go to moksha without a doubt.

[76] Those maayavaadis who defame the kalpavruksha Shri Madhwacharyaru are akin to donkeys and just by looking at
them one becomes patit.

[77] Those brahmanas who have hatred against Shri Madhwacharyaru are worse than chandalas. A knowledgeble person
should not even talk them or touch them.

[78] Those who eat the food of those who defame Shri Madhwacharyaru, anyone who looks at them, they should look at sun at once.

[79] Those who desire the things of those who defame Shri Madhwacharyaru, anyone who looks at them, they should look at sun at once.

[80] Those who bow to such people who defame Shri Madhwacharyaru, they have commited more sins than mating with ones own mother,
eating cows meat, consuming alcohal, murder.

[81] Those who do NOT scold those who scold Shri Madhwacharyaru, that person commits more sin than one who mates with teachers
wife, one who does brahmana murder, killing of cows.

[82] Those who do NOT scold those who scold Shri Madhwacharyaru, that person commits more sin than one who mates with ones own mother,
and a chandala.

[83] Those who do ninda of Shri Madhwacharyaru go to hell no doubt, if anybody does not oppose them, they he will go to andha tamas.

[84] That day when there is no discussion about Madhwashaastra, that day is a sad day and not the day when the nation is covered with
mletchas.

[85] That day when there is no scolding of those who abuse about Madhwashaastra, that day is a sad day and not the day when the nation is covered with
mletchas.

[86] How much more can be told on this topic, all the vedas and puranas mention the same that the devotees of Shri Madhwacharyaru go to moksha
and those who study maayavaada go to andhatamas.

[87] At the beginning of new study, during marriage time, at the entrance of kings gate, in midst of a gathering one should always remember
our Guru Shri Madhwacharyaru.

[88] Even if by chance the devotee of Shri Madhwacharyaru commits a sin by mistake, due to the command of Shri Madhwacharyaru, Yama will not
look at this person and cause trouble.

[89-90] Those brahmanas who are well versed in Shri Madhwashaastra, those people on whomsoever they set their sights on become pure. There is
no doubt about it.

[91] In whose heart there is Shri Madhwacharyaru who destroys all sins, for them everyday is a festival, lucky and wealthy.

[92] Those who are in hell, just by taking the name of Shri Madhwacharyaru will get released from naraka. They will depart from yamaloka
and proceed towards moksha.

[93] Those who worship the avatara of Mukhyaprana devaru, ie Shri Madhwacharyaru, they will go to moksha by the command of Shri Madhwacharyaru.

[94] In this world those who hates Shri Madhwacharyaru who is Sadguru for all pious good people, those peope would be tied like a horse and
beaten by knowledgeble people.

[95] Those who do not surrender to Shri Madhwacharyaru who is most dearest to Shri Hari, Shri Hari also will not take them in and will
discard them like vali was discarded.

[96] Those who surrender and worship Shri Madhwacharyaru, Shri Hari will also accept them without a doubt.

[97] Those who ignore the Guru of 3 worlds Shri Madhwacharyaru, Shri Hari also would ignore them

[98] Those maayavaadis who hate the best of all jeevas,Shri Madhwacharyaru, those people are hated by devatas also. This is without
a doubt.

[99] One who worships Shri Madhwacharyaru as just better than Shesha and others, that person is a medium level person and will
get good and bad things in equal proportions.

[100] Those who sing about Shri Madhwacharyaru with devotion, they will be the dearest devotee of Shri Hari and will always
enjoy in Vaikunta.
[101] Lord Shri Hari is the supreme most of all and Shri Madhwacharyaru is the most favourite disciple of Shri Hari and always
wishes well, thus Shri Madhwacharyaru is most respectable of all.

[102] Sankara is popular as one who hates Shri Madhwacharyaru, thus anyone who befriends Sankara or befriends the friend of
Sankara that person is also a hater of Shri Madhwacharyaru.

[103] That person who leaves the marks of Shri Madhwacharyaru and instead puts on the marks of Sankara, that fool is also
a hater of Shri Madhwacharyaru.

[104] Shri does not get pleased only by Ganga bath, but If somebody does scolding of haters of Shri Madhwacharyaru, then
Shri Hari will be pleased.

[105] By the command of Shri Hari, its allowed to eat the food that has been consumed by Shri Madhwacharyaru. Thus food should
be offered to Shri Madhwacharyaru.

[106] Those who wish that whatever is given by them becomes infinite, then that person should do naivedya to the most brilliant
lustred, one who propels everyone from inside, one who is fully knowledgeble, one who is the most peaceful one, ie Shri Madhwacharyaru.

[107] One who does namaste to those who hate Shri Madhwacharyaru, that persons hand should be cut and thrown into ocean.

[108] Shri does not get pleased only by Anna daana, but If somebody does scolding of haters of Shri Madhwacharyaru, then
Shri Hari will be pleased.

[109] Those who know Madhwashaastra should not be at a prostitutes house, nor a person who troubles others, but if such a person
is in the house of someone who hates Shri Madhwacharyaru, then he gets more sin than the above.

[110] Those who ignore this and lives with one who hates Shri Madhwacharyaru, that person will also be called a hater of Shri Madhwacharyaru
one day and he will go to andha tamas for sure.

[111] The wells, baths, lakes that is built by who hate Shri Madhwacharyaru, it is not acceptable and should be left as they cause naraka.

[112] That brahmana who is a devotee of Shri Madhwacharyaru and Shri Madhwacharyaru is pleased with him, if such a brahmana enters anybodys
house, that person will become knowledgeble gyaani and all good things will happen to him.
This is the completion of MadhwamruthaMaharnava composed by Narayan Pandithachaaryaru who is the son of Trivikrama Pandithacharyaru.
